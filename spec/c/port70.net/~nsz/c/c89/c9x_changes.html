<H2>What is C9X?</H2>

<P>
C9X is the name for an effort undertaken in the late nineteen-nineties
to produce a new improved standard for the programming language C. An ISO
committee has been working to define this new improved language. In december
1997, they released their first public draft version of the new standard for
public review. Later, they also released the
<A HREF="http://wwwold.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/open/n2794/">C9X FCD</A>.
(I suppose that "FCD" stands for "Final Committee Draft".) This document
can also be obtained in
<A HREF="http://wwwold.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n843.ps.gz">gzipped
Postscript</A> form.
</P>
<P>
The new ISO standard for the programming language was ratified by ISO in
1999. Its ISO document number should therefore be ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (I didn't
verify this.)
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Please note</STRONG> that the final standard as it has been ratified
<EM>may differ substantially</EM> from the <EM>working document</EM> referenced

<H2>What is new in C9X?</H2>

<P>
Clearly, the first question any C programmer will ask now is "And what's
new in C?"
</P>
<P>
Back in 1998, I compiled a list of changes based on the above final
committe draft of the new ISO standard. I have never gotten any complaint
saying that the information here was incorrect, so I guess the final standard
did not deviate too much from the FCD. The ISO work group has published its own
<A HREF="http://wwwold.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/newinc9x.htm">list of
changes</A>, but it's not exactly verbose...
</P>
<P>
I still offer this list of changes because it seems still to be reasonably accurate,
and it will give you a first impression of what the new C is like. Of course, for
the full story, you'll have to get hold of a copy of the new ISO standard. Although
I tried my best, I do not guarantee the information provided here to be correct.
(As I wrote above, this list is based on the FCD, <EM>not</EM> the final new ISO
standard.)
<P>
In what follows, I'll refer to C as it is defined by its original ISO
standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1990, including technical corrigenda
<A HREF="ftp://dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/tc1.htm">TC1</A> and
<A HREF="ftp://dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/tc2.htm">TC2</A>) as
<STRONG>C89</STRONG>, the language as defined by C89 plus the normative
addendum 1 is referred to as <STRONG>C94</STRONG>.
</P>

<H2>Changes from C89 to C9X</H2>

      <LI> Most of the translation limits (§5.2.4.1) have been increased,
           most notably, the implementation must support:
	   <UL TYPE="disc">
	     <LI>63 significant initial characters in an internal identifier
	         or macro name (universal or extended characters count as one),
	     <LI>31 significant initial characters in an external identifier
                 (counting "short" UCNs as 6 and "long" UCNs as 10, and
                 counting extended characters like the corresponding UCN),
	         and
	     <LI>4095 characters in a logical source line.
	   </UL>
	   These values were 31, 6, and 509, respectively, in C89. Note that
	   <EM>all</EM> identifiers are case sensitive now, even external
	   ones. (In C89, an implementation was allowed to ignore case for
	   external identifiers.)

      <LI VALUE=2>
           The <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directive has three reserved forms, all
           starting with the pp-token <CODE>STDC</CODE> right after "pragma".
	   These are used to specify certain characteristics of the
	   floating point support to comply with IEC 559.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> The <CODE>_Pragma</CODE> unary operator allows the construction of
           pragmas through macro expansion.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Predefined macro <CODE>__STDC_VERSION__</CODE> has now the value
           <CODE>199901L</CODE>. (In C94, it's value was <CODE>199409L</CODE>,
	   C89 didn't have it at all.) I suppose this value will be fixed
	   in the final version of the new standard to reflect the date of
	   its actual acceptance by ISO.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> There are two conditionally defined macros,
           <CODE>__STDC_IEC_559__</CODE> and <CODE>__STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__</CODE>,
	   indicating IEC 559 conformance for floating point and complex
	   arithmetic, respectively. If defined, they're defined to the
	   decimal constant 1. A third conditionally defined macro called
           <CODE>__STDC_ISO_10646__</CODE> shall indicate that <CODE>wchar_t</CODE>
           is in accordance with ISO/IEC 10646. If defined, this macro has
           a value of the form <CODE>yyyymmL</CODE>.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Macro expansion: empty arguments are explicitly allowed. (In C89,
           this resulted in undefined behavior.) Stringification (the
	   <CODE>#</CODE> operator) of an empty argument yields the empty string,
	   concatenation (<CODE>##</CODE>) of an empty argument with a non-empty
	   argument produces the non-empty argument, and concatenation
	   of two empty arguments produces nothing at all.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Function-like macros with variable arguments, uses the ellipsis
           (<CODE>...</CODE>) notation. For replacement, the variable arguments
	   (including the separating commas) are "collected" into one single
	   extra argument that can be referenced as <CODE>__VA_ARGS__</CODE>
	   within the macro's replacement list. <CODE>__VA_ARGS__</CODE> may occur
	   <EM>only</EM> within the replacement list of a function-like macro
	   having a variable argument list. It's possible to have <EM>only</EM>
	   variable arguments, as in
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
 #define My_Macro(...) __VA_ARGS__</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI> The <CODE>#line</CODE> directive allows the specification of a line
           number up to 2**31-1. (In C89, the limit was 2**15-1, i.e. 32767.)
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> The syntax of preprocessing numbers has been changed to allow for
           the new binary exponents present in hexadecimal floating point
           constants.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Line-comments (starting with the pp-token "<CODE>//</CODE>" and
           extending up to the end of the line). As with normal comments,
	   it's not possible to construct a comment as the result of macro
	   replacement.

	   (possibly with a trailing comma before the closing brace).
	   Compound literals are primary expressions.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Initializers (and anonymous aggregates) have a named notation for
           initializing members. For array elements, the element is designated
           by <CODE>[const-expression]</CODE>, for struct and union members
	   using a dot notation <CODE>.member-name</CODE>. E.g.,
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
struct {int a[3], b;} w[] =
  { [0].a = {1}, [1].a = 2 };</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	   or
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
struct {int a, b, c, d;} s =
  { .a = 1, .c = 3, 4, .b = 5};</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	   Note: the '4' in the above initializer list initializes
	   <CODE>s.d</CODE>.
	   <BR><BR>
	   As usual, global data is by default set to zero (or to NULL in the
	   case of pointers). If an initializer is present, any members not
	   explicitly set also are zeroed out. (As in C89; the
	   <A HREF="string_init.html">clarifications from TC2</A> are retained
	   in C9X.)
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Notation for "universal characters":
           <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
<EM>universal-character-name:
  </EM><STRONG>\u</STRONG><EM> hex-quad
  </EM><STRONG>\U</STRONG><EM> hex-quad hex-quad

hex-quad:
  hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit
  hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit</EM></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	   Note that universal characters may appear even in the midst of
	   an identifier! (An implementation is allowed to do some name
	   mangling if the linker cannot deal with universal characters.)
	   I suppose this is intended to let e.g. the Japanese write their
	   identifiers using their Japanese characters (or symbols, or
	   glyphs, or whatever the linguistically correct term would be).
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Notation for hexadecimal floating point constants with binary
           exponent, i.e., the exponent is given as a decimal power of two.
           <BR><BR>
      <LI> New suffix "<CODE>LL</CODE>" or "<CODE>ll</CODE>" (and "<CODE>ULL</CODE>"
           and "<CODE>ull</CODE>", of course) for constants of the

	   where <CODE><EM>function-name</EM></CODE> is the unadorned name of
	   the function the identifier is used in. (Provides a means to
	   obtain the name of the current function, similar to the

	   (obviously) important only if one or both operands are negative.
	   Consider:
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
-22 / 7 = -3
-22 % 7 = -1</PRE></TD><TD>truncation towards zero</TD></TR>
<TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>

	   Both satisfy the required equation <CODE>(a/b)*b + a%b == a</CODE>.
	   The second has the advantage that the modulus is always positive
	   -- but they decided on the other (more Fortran-like, less
	   Pascal-like) variant...)
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Type specifiers: new combinations added for:
           <UL TYPE="disc">
             <LI><CODE>_Bool</CODE>
	     <LI><CODE>float _Complex</CODE>, <CODE>double _Complex</CODE>,
	         <CODE>long double _Complex</CODE>
             <LI><CODE>signed</CODE> and <CODE>unsigned long long int</CODE>.
	   </UL>
	   Note: it seems that these type specifiers may occur in any order,
	   e.g, <CODE>_Complex double long</CODE> or <CODE>signed long int long</CODE>
	   would be legal.
	   <BR><BR>
	   The implementation of the complex types is defined by the standard
	   (6.2.5(13)) to use cartesian coordinates (real and imaginary
	   part), i.e. forbids an implementation using polar coordinates
	   (distance from [0,0] and an angle). Furthermore, the same
	   paragraph also specifies that a complex type has the same alignment
	   requirements as an array of two elements of the corresponding
	   floating types, the first must be the real part and the second
	   the imaginary part.
	   <BR><BR>
           Objects of the new boolean type <CODE>_Bool</CODE> may have one of the
           two values zero or one.
           <BR><BR>
      <LI> In a declaration, there must be at least one type specifier, i.e.,
           the default to <CODE>int</CODE> has been thrown out. E.g., the
	   declaration
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>f();</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
           was equivalent to <CODE>int f();</CODE> in C89, but is illegal in C9X.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Structs: the last member may have an incomplete array type. (This
           is a way to codify the well-known "struct hack" that was widely
           used and in practice worked on nearly every compiler.) The idea is
           illustrated by the following piece of code:
	   <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD Class="code"><PRE>
struct s {int n; double d[];};
struct s *p1, *p2;
size_t   sz;

sz = sizeof (struct s);  // sz == offsetof (struct s, d)

p1 = malloc (sizeof (struct s) + 8 * sizeof (double));
p2 = malloc (sizeof (struct s) + 5 * sizeof (double));

/* p1 behaves now as if it had been declared as

   struct {int n; double d[8];} *p1;

   p2 behaves now as if it had been declared as

   struct {int n; double d[5];} *p2;
*/</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
           Note that the specification as given in the Committee Draft
	   implies that there be no padding before the variable last member,
	   or, if there is, that it be included in <CODE>sizeof (struct s)</CODE>.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> Type qualifiers are idempotent, i.e., if a type qualifier
           appears several times (either directly or indirectly through
           typedefs) in a type specification, it's treated as if it
           appeared only once. E.g. <CODE>const const int i;</CODE>  is equivalent
           to <CODE>const int i;</CODE>. (Note that in
	   <CODE>const int * const p;</CODE>, this doesn't apply as the second
	   <CODE>const</CODE> qualifies the pointer!)
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> There's a new type qualifier, called <CODE>restrict</CODE>. It's
           intended to be used only for pointer types (6.5.3(2)). Its
	   semantics is that two restrict-qualified pointers cannot be
	   aliases of the same object. A restricted pointer and a
	   non-restricted point <EM>can</EM> be aliases, though. This is
	   intended to facilitate alias analysis in compilers, allowing
	   more aggressive optimizations to be employed. For more information
	   on this new feature, see the
	   <A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/restrict.html">original
	   proposal X3J11 94-009, "Restricted Pointers"</A>.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> There's a new function specifier <CODE>inline</CODE>, giving the
           compiler a hint that such a function should be inlined.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> A compiler must parse and accept both <CODE>restrict</CODE> and
           <CODE>inline</CODE>, but is free to ignore the hints given by them.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> There are variable-length arrays, whose size depends not upon
           a constant expression but on a computed value.
	   Variable-length arrays must not be global or members of a struct
	   or union. Multi-dimensional variable-length arrays are allowed.
	   <BR><BR>
      <LI> The <CODE>goto</CODE> statement is not allowed to jump <EM>into</EM>
           the scope of a variable-length array. Jumps <EM>within</EM> such
	   a scope are allowed.
