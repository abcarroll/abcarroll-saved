1   ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International
    Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide
    standardization. National bodies that are member of ISO or IEC participate in the
    development of International Standards through technical committees established by the
    respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
    technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
    organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also
    take part in the work.
2   International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 3.
3   In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical
    committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical
    committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International
    Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the national bodies casting a vote.
4   International Standard ISO/IEC 9899 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee
    ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 22, Programming languages,
    their environments and system software interfaces. The Working Group responsible for
    this standard (WG 14) maintains a site on the World Wide Web at
    http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/                        containing      additional
    information relevant to this standard such as a Rationale for many of the decisions made
    during its preparation and a log of Defect Reports and Responses.
5   This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, ISO/IEC 9899:1990, as
    amended and corrected by ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1994, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and
    ISO/IEC 9899/COR2:1996. Major changes from the previous edition include:
    -- restricted character set support via digraphs and <a href="#7.9">&lt;iso646.h&gt;</a> (originally specified
      in AMD1)
    -- wide character library support in <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a> and <a href="#7.25">&lt;wctype.h&gt;</a> (originally
      specified in AMD1)
    -- more precise aliasing rules via effective type
    -- restricted pointers
    -- variable length arrays
    -- flexible array members
    -- static and type qualifiers in parameter array declarators
    -- complex (and imaginary) support in <a href="#7.3">&lt;complex.h&gt;</a>
    -- type-generic math macros in <a href="#7.22">&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</a>
    -- the long long int type and library functions

<a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction"><b>    Introduction</b></a>
1   With the introduction of new devices and extended character sets, new features may be
    added to this International Standard. Subclauses in the language and library clauses warn
    implementors and programmers of usages which, though valid in themselves, may
    conflict with future additions.
2   Certain features are obsolescent, which means that they may be considered for
    withdrawal in future revisions of this International Standard. They are retained because
    of their widespread use, but their use in new implementations (for implementation
    features) or new programs (for language [6.11] or library features [7.26]) is discouraged.
3   This International Standard is divided into four major subdivisions:
    -- preliminary elements (clauses 1-4);
    -- the characteristics of environments that translate and execute C programs (clause 5);
    -- the language syntax, constraints, and semantics (clause 6);
    -- the library facilities (clause 7).
4   Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the constructions described.
    Footnotes are provided to emphasize consequences of the rules described in that
    subclause or elsewhere in this International Standard. References are used to refer to
    other related subclauses. Recommendations are provided to give advice or guidance to
    implementors. Annexes provide additional information and summarize the information
    contained in this International Standard. A bibliography lists documents that were
    referred to during the preparation of the standard.
5   The language clause (clause 6) is derived from ''The C Reference Manual''.
6   The library clause (clause 7) is based on the 1984 /usr/group Standard.

<a name="4" href="#4"><b>    4. Conformance</b></a>
1   In this International Standard, ''shall'' is to be interpreted as a requirement on an
    implementation or on a program; conversely, ''shall not'' is to be interpreted as a
    prohibition.
2   If a ''shall'' or ''shall not'' requirement that appears outside of a constraint is violated, the
    behavior is undefined. Undefined behavior is otherwise indicated in this International
    Standard by the words ''undefined behavior'' or by the omission of any explicit definition
    of behavior. There is no difference in emphasis among these three; they all describe
    ''behavior that is undefined''.
3   A program that is correct in all other aspects, operating on correct data, containing
    unspecified behavior shall be a correct program and act in accordance with <a href="#5.1.2.3">5.1.2.3</a>.
4   The implementation shall not successfully translate a preprocessing translation unit
    containing a #error preprocessing directive unless it is part of a group skipped by
    conditional inclusion.
5   A strictly conforming program shall use only those features of the language and library
    specified in this International Standard.<sup><a href="#note2"><b>2)</b></a></sup> It shall not produce output dependent on any
    unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior, and shall not exceed any
    minimum implementation limit.
6   The two forms of conforming implementation are hosted and freestanding. A conforming
    hosted implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program. A conforming
    freestanding implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program that does not
    use complex types and in which the use of the features specified in the library clause
    (clause 7) is confined to the contents of the standard headers <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a>,
    <a href="#7.9">&lt;iso646.h&gt;</a>, <a href="#7.10">&lt;limits.h&gt;</a>, <a href="#7.15">&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</a>, <a href="#7.16">&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</a>, <a href="#7.17">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</a>, and
    <a href="#7.18">&lt;stdint.h&gt;</a>. A conforming implementation may have extensions (including additional
    library functions), provided they do not alter the behavior of any strictly conforming
    program.<sup><a href="#note3"><b>3)</b></a></sup>



    <sup><a name="note2" href="#note2"><b>2)</b></a></sup>   A strictly conforming program can use conditional features (such as those in <a href="#F">annex F</a>) provided the
         use is guarded by a #ifdef directive with the appropriate macro. For example:
                 #ifdef __STDC_IEC_559__ /* FE_UPWARD defined */
                    /* ... */
                    fesetround(FE_UPWARD);
                    /* ... */
                 #endif

    <sup><a name="note3" href="#note3"><b>3)</b></a></sup>   This implies that a conforming implementation reserves no identifiers other than those explicitly
         reserved in this International Standard.

7   A conforming program is one that is acceptable to a conforming implementation.<sup><a href="#note4"><b>4)</b></a></sup>

    defined and locale-specific characteristics and all extensions.

1   An implementation translates C source files and executes C programs in two data-
    processing-system environments, which will be called the translation environment and
    the execution environment in this International Standard. Their characteristics define and
    constrain the results of executing conforming C programs constructed according to the
    syntactic and semantic rules for conforming implementations.

    have been noted.

<a name="5.1.1.1" href="#5.1.1.1"><b>    5.1.1.1 Program structure</b></a>
1   A C program need not all be translated at the same time. The text of the program is kept
    in units called source files, (or preprocessing files) in this International Standard. A
    source file together with all the headers and source files included via the preprocessing
    directive #include is known as a preprocessing translation unit. After preprocessing, a
    preprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit. Previously translated translation
    units may be preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of a
    program communicate by (for example) calls to functions whose identifiers have external
    linkage, manipulation of objects whose identifiers have external linkage, or manipulation
    of data files. Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to
    produce an executable program.
    Forward references: linkages of identifiers (<a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2</a>), external definitions (<a href="#6.9">6.9</a>),

<a name="5.1.1.2" href="#5.1.1.2"><b>    5.1.1.2 Translation phases</b></a>
1   The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following
    phases.<sup><a href="#note5"><b>5)</b></a></sup>
         1. Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an implementation-
            defined manner, to the source character set (introducing new-line characters for
            end-of-line indicators) if necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by
            corresponding single-character internal representations.



    <sup><a name="note5" href="#note5"><b>5)</b></a></sup>    Implementations shall behave as if these separate phases occur, even though many are typically folded
          together in practice. Source files, translation units, and translated translation units need not
          necessarily be stored as files, nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these entities
          and any external representation. The description is conceptual only, and does not specify any
          particular implementation.

[<a name="p9" href="#p9">page 9</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

     2. Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line
        character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines.
        Only the last backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
        of such a splice. A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
        which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such
        splicing takes place.
     3. The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens<sup><a href="#note6"><b>6)</b></a></sup> and sequences of
        white-space characters (including comments). A source file shall not end in a
        partial preprocessing token or in a partial comment. Each comment is replaced by
        one space character. New-line characters are retained. Whether each nonempty
        sequence of white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced by
        one space character is implementation-defined.
     4.   Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and
          _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. If a character sequence that
          matches the syntax of a universal character name is produced by token
          concatenation (<a href="#6.10.3.3">6.10.3.3</a>), the behavior is undefined. A #include preprocessing
          directive causes the named header or source file to be processed from phase 1
          through phase 4, recursively. All preprocessing directives are then deleted.
     5.   Each source character set member and escape sequence in character constants and
          string literals is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character
          set; if there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an implementation-
          defined member other than the null (wide) character.<sup><a href="#note7"><b>7)</b></a></sup>
     6. Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
     7. White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each
        preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens are
        syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.
     8. All external object and function references are resolved. Library components are
        linked to satisfy external references to functions and objects not defined in the
        current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image
        which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment.

<sup><a name="note6" href="#note6"><b>6)</b></a></sup>    As described in <a href="#6.4">6.4</a>, the process of dividing a source file's characters into preprocessing tokens is

1   The function called at program startup is named main. The implementation declares no
    prototype for this function. It shall be defined with a return type of int and with no
    parameters:
            int main(void) { /* ... */ }
    or with two parameters (referred to here as argc and argv, though any names may be
    used, as they are local to the function in which they are declared):
            int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { /* ... */ }
    or equivalent;<sup><a href="#note9"><b>9)</b></a></sup> or in some other implementation-defined manner.
2   If they are declared, the parameters to the main function shall obey the following
    constraints:
    -- The value of argc shall be nonnegative.
    -- argv[argc] shall be a null pointer.
    -- If the value of argc is greater than zero, the array members argv[0] through
      argv[argc-1] inclusive shall contain pointers to strings, which are given
      implementation-defined values by the host environment prior to program startup. The
      intent is to supply to the program information determined prior to program startup
      from elsewhere in the hosted environment. If the host environment is not capable of
      supplying strings with letters in both uppercase and lowercase, the implementation
      shall ensure that the strings are received in lowercase.
    -- If the value of argc is greater than zero, the string pointed to by argv[0]
      represents the program name; argv[0][0] shall be the null character if the
      program name is not available from the host environment. If the value of argc is
      greater than one, the strings pointed to by argv[1] through argv[argc-1]

1   The semantic descriptions in this International Standard describe the behavior of an
    abstract machine in which issues of optimization are irrelevant.
2   Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a function
    that does any of those operations are all side effects,<sup><a href="#note11"><b>11)</b></a></sup> which are changes in the state of
    the execution environment. Evaluation of an expression may produce side effects. At
    certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence points, all side effects
    of previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of subsequent evaluations
    shall have taken place. (A summary of the sequence points is given in <a href="#C">annex C</a>.)
3   In the abstract machine, all expressions are evaluated as specified by the semantics. An
    actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its
    value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced (including any caused by
    calling a function or accessing a volatile object).
4   When the processing of the abstract machine is interrupted by receipt of a signal, only the
    values of objects as of the previous sequence point may be relied on. Objects that may be
    modified between the previous sequence point and the next sequence point need not have
    received their correct values yet.
5   The least requirements on a conforming implementation are:
    -- At sequence points, volatile objects are stable in the sense that previous accesses are
      complete and subsequent accesses have not yet occurred.




    <sup><a name="note10" href="#note10"><b>10)</b></a></sup> In accordance with <a href="#6.2.4">6.2.4</a>, the lifetimes of objects with automatic storage duration declared in main
        will have ended in the former case, even where they would not have in the latter.
    <sup><a name="note11" href="#note11"><b>11)</b></a></sup> The IEC 60559 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic requires certain user-accessible status
        flags and control modes. Floating-point operations implicitly set the status flags; modes affect result
        values of floating-point operations. Implementations that support such floating-point state are
        required to regard changes to it as side effects -- see <a href="#F">annex F</a> for details. The floating-point
        environment library <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> provides a programming facility for indicating when these side
        effects matter, freeing the implementations in other cases.

     -- At program termination, all data written into files shall be identical to the result that
       execution of the program according to the abstract semantics would have produced.
     -- The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take place as specified in
<a name="7.19.3" href="#7.19.3"><b>       7.19.3. The intent of these requirements is that unbuffered or line-buffered output</b></a>
       appear as soon as possible, to ensure that prompting messages actually appear prior to
       a program waiting for input.
6    What constitutes an interactive device is implementation-defined.
7    More stringent correspondences between abstract and actual semantics may be defined by
     each implementation.
8    EXAMPLE 1 An implementation might define a one-to-one correspondence between abstract and actual
     semantics: at every sequence point, the values of the actual objects would agree with those specified by the
     abstract semantics. The keyword volatile would then be redundant.
9    Alternatively, an implementation might perform various optimizations within each translation unit, such
     that the actual semantics would agree with the abstract semantics only when making function calls across
     translation unit boundaries. In such an implementation, at the time of each function entry and function
     return where the calling function and the called function are in different translation units, the values of all
     externally linked objects and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract
     semantics. Furthermore, at the time of each such function entry the values of the parameters of the called
     function and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract semantics. In this
     type of implementation, objects referred to by interrupt service routines activated by the signal function
     would require explicit specification of volatile storage, as well as other implementation-defined
     restrictions.

10   EXAMPLE 2       In executing the fragment
              char c1, c2;
              /* ... */
              c1 = c1 + c2;
     the ''integer promotions'' require that the abstract machine promote the value of each variable to int size
     and then add the two ints and truncate the sum. Provided the addition of two chars can be done without
     overflow, or with overflow wrapping silently to produce the correct result, the actual execution need only
     produce the same result, possibly omitting the promotions.

11   EXAMPLE 3       Similarly, in the fragment
              float f1, f2;
              double d;
              /* ... */
              f1 = f2 * d;
     the multiplication may be executed using single-precision arithmetic if the implementation can ascertain
     that the result would be the same as if it were executed using double-precision arithmetic (for example, if d
     were replaced by the constant 2.0, which has type double).

[<a name="p14" href="#p14">page 14</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

12   EXAMPLE 4 Implementations employing wide registers have to take care to honor appropriate
     semantics. Values are independent of whether they are represented in a register or in memory. For
     example, an implicit spilling of a register is not permitted to alter the value. Also, an explicit store and load
     is required to round to the precision of the storage type. In particular, casts and assignments are required to
     perform their specified conversion. For the fragment
              double d1, d2;
              float f;
              d1 = f = expression;
              d2 = (float) expression;
     the values assigned to d1 and d2 are required to have been converted to float.

13   EXAMPLE 5 Rearrangement for floating-point expressions is often restricted because of limitations in
     precision as well as range. The implementation cannot generally apply the mathematical associative rules
     for addition or multiplication, nor the distributive rule, because of roundoff error, even in the absence of
     overflow and underflow. Likewise, implementations cannot generally replace decimal constants in order to
     rearrange expressions. In the following fragment, rearrangements suggested by mathematical rules for real
     numbers are often not valid (see <a href="#F.8">F.8</a>).
              double x, y, z;
              /* ... */
              x = (x * y) * z;            //   not equivalent to x   *= y * z;
              z = (x - y) + y ;           //   not equivalent to z   = x;
              z = x + x * y;              //   not equivalent to z   = x * (1.0 + y);
              y = x / 5.0;                //   not equivalent to y   = x * 0.2;

14   EXAMPLE 6 To illustrate the grouping behavior of expressions, in the following fragment
              int a, b;
              /* ... */
              a = a + 32760 + b + 5;
     the expression statement behaves exactly the same as
              a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);
     due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the result of the sum (a + 32760) is
     next added to b, and that result is then added to 5 which results in the value assigned to a. On a machine in
     which overflows produce an explicit trap and in which the range of values representable by an int is
     [-32768, +32767], the implementation cannot rewrite this expression as
              a = ((a + b) + 32765);
     since if the values for a and b were, respectively, -32754 and -15, the sum a + b would produce a trap
     while the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten either as
              a = ((a + 32765) + b);
     or
              a = (a + (b + 32765));
     since the values for a and b might have been, respectively, 4 and -8 or -17 and 12. However, on a machine
     in which overflow silently generates some value and where positive and negative overflows cancel, the
     above expression statement can be rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the
     same result will occur.

[<a name="p15" href="#p15">page 15</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

15   EXAMPLE 7 The grouping of an expression does not completely determine its evaluation. In the
     following fragment
              #include <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>
              int sum;
              char *p;
              /* ... */
              sum = sum * 10 - '0' + (*p++ = getchar());
     the expression statement is grouped as if it were written as
              sum = (((sum * 10) - '0') + ((*(p++)) = (getchar())));
     but the actual increment of p can occur at any time between the previous sequence point and the next
     sequence point (the ;), and the call to getchar can occur at any point prior to the need of its returned
     value.

1   The active position is that location on a display device where the next character output by

1   The characteristics of floating types are defined in terms of a model that describes a
    representation of floating-point numbers and values that provide information about an
    implementation's floating-point arithmetic.<sup><a href="#note16"><b>16)</b></a></sup> The following parameters are used to
    define the model for each floating-point type:
           s          sign ((+-)1)
           b          base or radix of exponent representation (an integer &gt; 1)
           e          exponent (an integer between a minimum emin and a maximum emax )
           p          precision (the number of base-b digits in the significand)
            fk        nonnegative integers less than b (the significand digits)
2   A floating-point number (x) is defined by the following model:
                       p
           x = sb e   (Sum) f k b-k ,
                      k=1
                                     emin &lt;= e &lt;= emax

3   In addition to normalized floating-point numbers ( f 1 &gt; 0 if x != 0), floating types may be
    able to contain other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as subnormal floating-point
    numbers (x != 0, e = emin , f 1 = 0) and unnormalized floating-point numbers (x != 0,
    e &gt; emin , f 1 = 0), and values that are not floating-point numbers, such as infinities and
    NaNs. A NaN is an encoding signifying Not-a-Number. A quiet NaN propagates
    through almost every arithmetic operation without raising a floating-point exception; a
    signaling NaN generally raises a floating-point exception when occurring as an

    arithmetic operand.<sup><a href="#note17"><b>17)</b></a></sup>
4   An implementation may give zero and non-numeric values (such as infinities and NaNs) a
    sign or may leave them unsigned. Wherever such values are unsigned, any requirement
    in this International Standard to retrieve the sign shall produce an unspecified sign, and
    any requirement to set the sign shall be ignored.
5   The accuracy of the floating-point operations (+, -, *, /) and of the library functions in
    <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> and <a href="#7.3">&lt;complex.h&gt;</a> that return floating-point results is implementation-
    defined, as is the accuracy of the conversion between floating-point internal
    representations and string representations performed by the library functions in
    <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>, <a href="#7.20">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</a>, and <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a>. The implementation may state that the
    accuracy is unknown.
6   All integer values in the <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a> header, except FLT_ROUNDS, shall be constant
    expressions suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives; all floating values shall be
    constant expressions. All except DECIMAL_DIG, FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX,
    and FLT_ROUNDS have separate names for all three floating-point types. The floating-
    point model representation is provided for all values except FLT_EVAL_METHOD and
    FLT_ROUNDS.
7   The rounding mode for floating-point addition is characterized by the implementation-
    defined value of FLT_ROUNDS:<sup><a href="#note18"><b>18)</b></a></sup>
          -1      indeterminable

           3      toward negative infinity
    All other values for FLT_ROUNDS characterize implementation-defined rounding
    behavior.
8   Except for assignment and cast (which remove all extra range and precision), the values
    of operations with floating operands and values subject to the usual arithmetic
    conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format whose range and precision
    may be greater than required by the type. The use of evaluation formats is characterized
    by the implementation-defined value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD:<sup><a href="#note19"><b>19)</b></a></sup>

1   In the syntax notation used in this clause, syntactic categories (nonterminals) are
    indicated by italic type, and literal words and character set members (terminals) by bold
    type. A colon (:) following a nonterminal introduces its definition. Alternative
    definitions are listed on separate lines, except when prefaced by the words ''one of''. An
    optional symbol is indicated by the subscript ''opt'', so that
             { expressionopt }
    indicates an optional expression enclosed in braces.
2   When syntactic categories are referred to in the main text, they are not italicized and
    words are separated by spaces instead of hyphens.
3   A summary of the language syntax is given in <a href="#A">annex A</a>.
<a name="6.2" href="#6.2"><b>    6.2 Concepts</b></a>
<a name="6.2.1" href="#6.2.1"><b>    6.2.1 Scopes of identifiers</b></a>
1   An identifier can denote an object; a function; a tag or a member of a structure, union, or
    enumeration; a typedef name; a label name; a macro name; or a macro parameter. The
    same identifier can denote different entities at different points in the program. A member
    of an enumeration is called an enumeration constant. Macro names and macro
    parameters are not considered further here, because prior to the semantic phase of
    program translation any occurrences of macro names in the source file are replaced by the
    preprocessing token sequences that constitute their macro definitions.
2   For each different entity that an identifier designates, the identifier is visible (i.e., can be
    used) only within a region of program text called its scope. Different entities designated
    by the same identifier either have different scopes, or are in different name spaces. There
    are four kinds of scopes: function, file, block, and function prototype. (A function
    prototype is a declaration of a function that declares the types of its parameters.)
3   A label name is the only kind of identifier that has function scope. It can be used (in a
    goto statement) anywhere in the function in which it appears, and is declared implicitly
    by its syntactic appearance (followed by a : and a statement).
4   Every other identifier has scope determined by the placement of its declaration (in a
    declarator or type specifier). If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier
    appears outside of any block or list of parameters, the identifier has file scope, which
    terminates at the end of the translation unit. If the declarator or type specifier that
    declares the identifier appears inside a block or within the list of parameter declarations in
    a function definition, the identifier has block scope, which terminates at the end of the
    associated block. If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier appears

[<a name="p29" href="#p29">page 29</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype (not part of a function
    definition), the identifier has function prototype scope, which terminates at the end of the
    function declarator. If an identifier designates two different entities in the same name
    space, the scopes might overlap. If so, the scope of one entity (the inner scope) will be a
    strict subset of the scope of the other entity (the outer scope). Within the inner scope, the
    identifier designates the entity declared in the inner scope; the entity declared in the outer
    scope is hidden (and not visible) within the inner scope.
5   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, where this International Standard uses the term
    ''identifier'' to refer to some entity (as opposed to the syntactic construct), it refers to the
    entity in the relevant name space whose declaration is visible at the point the identifier
    occurs.
6   Two identifiers have the same scope if and only if their scopes terminate at the same
    point.
7   Structure, union, and enumeration tags have scope that begins just after the appearance of
    the tag in a type specifier that declares the tag. Each enumeration constant has scope that
    begins just after the appearance of its defining enumerator in an enumerator list. Any
    other identifier has scope that begins just after the completion of its declarator.

<a name="6.2.2" href="#6.2.2"><b>    6.2.2 Linkages of identifiers</b></a>
1   An identifier declared in different scopes or in the same scope more than once can be
    made to refer to the same object or function by a process called linkage.<sup><a href="#note21"><b>21)</b></a></sup> There are
    three kinds of linkage: external, internal, and none.
2   In the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program, each
    declaration of a particular identifier with external linkage denotes the same object or
    function. Within one translation unit, each declaration of an identifier with internal
    linkage denotes the same object or function. Each declaration of an identifier with no
    linkage denotes a unique entity.
3   If the declaration of a file scope identifier for an object or a function contains the storage-
    class specifier static, the identifier has internal linkage.<sup><a href="#note22"><b>22)</b></a></sup>
4   For an identifier declared with the storage-class specifier extern in a scope in which a



    <sup><a name="note21" href="#note21"><b>21)</b></a></sup> There is no linkage between different identifiers.
    <sup><a name="note22" href="#note22"><b>22)</b></a></sup> A function declaration can contain the storage-class specifier static only if it is at file scope; see

    prior declaration of that identifier is visible,<sup><a href="#note23"><b>23)</b></a></sup> if the prior declaration specifies internal or
    external linkage, the linkage of the identifier at the later declaration is the same as the
    linkage specified at the prior declaration. If no prior declaration is visible, or if the prior
    declaration specifies no linkage, then the identifier has external linkage.
5   If the declaration of an identifier for a function has no storage-class specifier, its linkage
    is determined exactly as if it were declared with the storage-class specifier extern. If
    the declaration of an identifier for an object has file scope and no storage-class specifier,
    its linkage is external.
6   The following identifiers have no linkage: an identifier declared to be anything other than
    an object or a function; an identifier declared to be a function parameter; a block scope
    identifier for an object declared without the storage-class specifier extern.
7   If, within a translation unit, the same identifier appears with both internal and external
    linkage, the behavior is undefined.

1   If more than one declaration of a particular identifier is visible at any point in a

    Thus, there are separate name spaces for various categories of identifiers, as follows:
    -- label names (disambiguated by the syntax of the label declaration and use);
    -- the tags of structures, unions, and enumerations (disambiguated by following any<sup><a href="#note24"><b>24)</b></a></sup>
      of the keywords struct, union, or enum);
    -- the members of structures or unions; each structure or union has a separate name
      space for its members (disambiguated by the type of the expression used to access the
      member via the . or -&gt; operator);

<a name="6.2.4" href="#6.2.4"><b>    6.2.4 Storage durations of objects</b></a>
1   An object has a storage duration that determines its lifetime. There are three storage
    durations: static, automatic, and allocated. Allocated storage is described in <a href="#7.20.3">7.20.3</a>.
2   The lifetime of an object is the portion of program execution during which storage is
    guaranteed to be reserved for it. An object exists, has a constant address,<sup><a href="#note25"><b>25)</b></a></sup> and retains
    its last-stored value throughout its lifetime.<sup><a href="#note26"><b>26)</b></a></sup> If an object is referred to outside of its
    lifetime, the behavior is undefined. The value of a pointer becomes indeterminate when
    the object it points to reaches the end of its lifetime.
3   An object whose identifier is declared with external or internal linkage, or with the
    storage-class specifier static has static storage duration. Its lifetime is the entire
    execution of the program and its stored value is initialized only once, prior to program
    startup.
4   An object whose identifier is declared with no linkage and without the storage-class
    specifier static has automatic storage duration.
5   For such an object that does not have a variable length array type, its lifetime extends
    from entry into the block with which it is associated until execution of that block ends in
    any way. (Entering an enclosed block or calling a function suspends, but does not end,
    execution of the current block.) If the block is entered recursively, a new instance of the
    object is created each time. The initial value of the object is indeterminate. If an
    initialization is specified for the object, it is performed each time the declaration is
    reached in the execution of the block; otherwise, the value becomes indeterminate each
    time the declaration is reached.
6   For such an object that does have a variable length array type, its lifetime extends from
    the declaration of the object until execution of the program leaves the scope of the
    declaration.<sup><a href="#note27"><b>27)</b></a></sup> If the scope is entered recursively, a new instance of the object is created
    each time. The initial value of the object is indeterminate.

    <sup><a name="note25" href="#note25"><b>25)</b></a></sup> The term ''constant address'' means that two pointers to the object constructed at possibly different

<a name="6.2.5" href="#6.2.5"><b>    6.2.5 Types</b></a>
1   The meaning of a value stored in an object or returned by a function is determined by the
    type of the expression used to access it. (An identifier declared to be an object is the
    simplest such expression; the type is specified in the declaration of the identifier.) Types
    are partitioned into object types (types that fully describe objects), function types (types
    that describe functions), and incomplete types (types that describe objects but lack
    information needed to determine their sizes).
2   An object declared as type _Bool is large enough to store the values 0 and 1.
3   An object declared as type char is large enough to store any member of the basic
    execution character set. If a member of the basic execution character set is stored in a
    char object, its value is guaranteed to be nonnegative. If any other character is stored in
    a char object, the resulting value is implementation-defined but shall be within the range
    of values that can be represented in that type.
4   There are five standard signed integer types, designated as signed char, short
    int, int, long int, and long long int. (These and other types may be
    designated in several additional ways, as described in <a href="#6.7.2">6.7.2</a>.) There may also be
    implementation-defined extended signed integer types.<sup><a href="#note28"><b>28)</b></a></sup> The standard and extended
    signed integer types are collectively called signed integer types.<sup><a href="#note29"><b>29)</b></a></sup>
5   An object declared as type signed char occupies the same amount of storage as a
    ''plain'' char object. A ''plain'' int object has the natural size suggested by the
    architecture of the execution environment (large enough to contain any value in the range
    INT_MIN to INT_MAX as defined in the header <a href="#7.10">&lt;limits.h&gt;</a>).
6   For each of the signed integer types, there is a corresponding (but different) unsigned
    integer type (designated with the keyword unsigned) that uses the same amount of
    storage (including sign information) and has the same alignment requirements. The type
    _Bool and the unsigned integer types that correspond to the standard signed integer
    types are the standard unsigned integer types. The unsigned integer types that
    correspond to the extended signed integer types are the extended unsigned integer types.
    The standard and extended unsigned integer types are collectively called unsigned integer
    types.<sup><a href="#note30"><b>30)</b></a></sup>



    <sup><a name="note28" href="#note28"><b>28)</b></a></sup> Implementation-defined keywords shall have the form of an identifier reserved for any use as

    <sup><a name="note29" href="#note29"><b>29)</b></a></sup> Therefore, any statement in this Standard about signed integer types also applies to the extended
        signed integer types.
    <sup><a name="note30" href="#note30"><b>30)</b></a></sup> Therefore, any statement in this Standard about unsigned integer types also applies to the extended
        unsigned integer types.

[<a name="p33" href="#p33">page 33</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

7    The standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types are collectively
     called the standard integer types, the extended signed integer types and extended
     unsigned integer types are collectively called the extended integer types.
8    For any two integer types with the same signedness and different integer conversion rank
     (see <a href="#6.3.1.1">6.3.1.1</a>), the range of values of the type with smaller integer conversion rank is a
     subrange of the values of the other type.
9    The range of nonnegative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the
     corresponding unsigned integer type, and the representation of the same value in each
     type is the same.<sup><a href="#note31"><b>31)</b></a></sup> A computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow,
     because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is
     reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be
     represented by the resulting type.
10   There are three real floating types, designated as float, double, and long
     double.<sup><a href="#note32"><b>32)</b></a></sup> The set of values of the type float is a subset of the set of values of the
     type double; the set of values of the type double is a subset of the set of values of the
     type long double.
11   There are three complex types, designated as float _Complex, double
     _Complex, and long double _Complex.<sup><a href="#note33"><b>33)</b></a></sup> The real floating and complex types
     are collectively called the floating types.
12   For each floating type there is a corresponding real type, which is always a real floating
     type. For real floating types, it is the same type. For complex types, it is the type given
     by deleting the keyword _Complex from the type name.
13   Each complex type has the same representation and alignment requirements as an array
     type containing exactly two elements of the corresponding real type; the first element is
     equal to the real part, and the second element to the imaginary part, of the complex
     number.
14   The type char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the floating types are
     collectively called the basic types. Even if the implementation defines two or more basic
     types to have the same representation, they are nevertheless different types.<sup><a href="#note34"><b>34)</b></a></sup>

     <sup><a name="note31" href="#note31"><b>31)</b></a></sup> The same representation and alignment requirements are meant to imply interchangeability as
         arguments to functions, return values from functions, and members of unions.

     <sup><a name="note34" href="#note34"><b>34)</b></a></sup> An implementation may define new keywords that provide alternative ways to designate a basic (or
         any other) type; this does not violate the requirement that all basic types be different.
         Implementation-defined keywords shall have the form of an identifier reserved for any use as
         described in <a href="#7.1.3">7.1.3</a>.

[<a name="p34" href="#p34">page 34</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

15   The three types char, signed char, and unsigned char are collectively called
     the character types. The implementation shall define char to have the same range,
     representation, and behavior as either signed char or unsigned char.<sup><a href="#note35"><b>35)</b></a></sup>
16   An enumeration comprises a set of named integer constant values. Each distinct
     enumeration constitutes a different enumerated type.
17   The type char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the enumerated types are
     collectively called integer types. The integer and real floating types are collectively called
     real types.
18   Integer and floating types are collectively called arithmetic types. Each arithmetic type
     belongs to one type domain: the real type domain comprises the real types, the complex
     type domain comprises the complex types.
19   The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete type that cannot be
     completed.
20   Any number of derived types can be constructed from the object, function, and
     incomplete types, as follows:
     -- An array type describes a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a
       particular member object type, called the element type.<sup><a href="#note36"><b>36)</b></a></sup> Array types are
       characterized by their element type and by the number of elements in the array. An
       array type is said to be derived from its element type, and if its element type is T , the

     -- A pointer type may be derived from a function type, an object type, or an incomplete
       type, called the referenced type. A pointer type describes an object whose value
       provides a reference to an entity of the referenced type. A pointer type derived from
       the referenced type T is sometimes called ''pointer to T ''. The construction of a
       pointer type from a referenced type is called ''pointer type derivation''.
     These methods of constructing derived types can be applied recursively.
21   Arithmetic types and pointer types are collectively called scalar types. Array and
     structure types are collectively called aggregate types.<sup><a href="#note37"><b>37)</b></a></sup>
22   An array type of unknown size is an incomplete type. It is completed, for an identifier of
     that type, by specifying the size in a later declaration (with internal or external linkage).
     A structure or union type of unknown content (as described in <a href="#6.7.2.3">6.7.2.3</a>) is an incomplete
     type. It is completed, for all declarations of that type, by declaring the same structure or
     union tag with its defining content later in the same scope.
23   A type has known constant size if the type is not incomplete and is not a variable length
     array type.
24   Array, function, and pointer types are collectively called derived declarator types. A
     declarator type derivation from a type T is the construction of a derived declarator type
     from T by the application of an array-type, a function-type, or a pointer-type derivation to
     T.
25   A type is characterized by its type category, which is either the outermost derivation of a
     derived type (as noted above in the construction of derived types), or the type itself if the
     type consists of no derived types.
26   Any type so far mentioned is an unqualified type. Each unqualified type has several
     qualified versions of its type,<sup><a href="#note38"><b>38)</b></a></sup> corresponding to the combinations of one, two, or all
     three of the const, volatile, and restrict qualifiers. The qualified or unqualified
     versions of a type are distinct types that belong to the same type category and have the
     same representation and alignment requirements.<sup><a href="#note39"><b>39)</b></a></sup> A derived type is not qualified by the
     qualifiers (if any) of the type from which it is derived.

     the number, order, and encoding of which are either explicitly specified or

3    Values stored in unsigned bit-fields and objects of type unsigned char shall be

4    Values stored in non-bit-field objects of any other object type consist of n x CHAR_BIT
     bits, where n is the size of an object of that type, in bytes. The value may be copied into
     an object of type unsigned char [n] (e.g., by memcpy); the resulting set of bytes is
     called the object representation of the value. Values stored in bit-fields consist of m bits,
     where m is the size specified for the bit-field. The object representation is the set of m
     bits the bit-field comprises in the addressable storage unit holding it. Two values (other
     than NaNs) with the same object representation compare equal, but values that compare
     equal may have different object representations.
5    Certain object representations need not represent a value of the object type. If the stored
     value of an object has such a representation and is read by an lvalue expression that does

1   For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, the bits of the object
    representation shall be divided into two groups: value bits and padding bits (there need
    not be any of the latter). If there are N value bits, each bit shall represent a different
    power of 2 between 1 and 2 N -1 , so that objects of that type shall be capable of
    representing values from 0 to 2 N - 1 using a pure binary representation; this shall be
    known as the value representation. The values of any padding bits are unspecified.<sup><a href="#note44"><b>44)</b></a></sup>
2   For signed integer types, the bits of the object representation shall be divided into three
    groups: value bits, padding bits, and the sign bit. There need not be any padding bits;

    <sup><a name="note41" href="#note41"><b>41)</b></a></sup> Thus, an automatic variable can be initialized to a trap representation without causing undefined

    <sup><a name="note43" href="#note43"><b>43)</b></a></sup> It is possible for objects x and y with the same effective type T to have the same value when they are
        accessed as objects of type T, but to have different values in other contexts. In particular, if == is
        defined for type T, then x == y does not imply that memcmp(&amp;x, &amp;y, sizeof (T)) == 0.
        Furthermore, x == y does not necessarily imply that x and y have the same value; other operations
        on values of type T may distinguish between them.
    <sup><a name="note44" href="#note44"><b>44)</b></a></sup> Some combinations of padding bits might generate trap representations, for example, if one padding

        representation other than as part of an exceptional condition such as an overflow, and this cannot occur
        with unsigned types. All other combinations of padding bits are alternative object representations of

    there shall be exactly one sign bit. Each bit that is a value bit shall have the same value as
    the same bit in the object representation of the corresponding unsigned type (if there are
    M value bits in the signed type and N in the unsigned type, then M &lt;= N ). If the sign bit
    is zero, it shall not affect the resulting value. If the sign bit is one, the value shall be
    modified in one of the following ways:
    -- the corresponding value with sign bit 0 is negated (sign and magnitude);
    -- the sign bit has the value -(2 N ) (two's complement);
    -- the sign bit has the value -(2 N - 1) (ones' complement ).
    Which of these applies is implementation-defined, as is whether the value with sign bit 1
    and all value bits zero (for the first two), or with sign bit and all value bits 1 (for ones'
    complement), is a trap representation or a normal value. In the case of sign and
    magnitude and ones' complement, if this representation is a normal value it is called a
    negative zero.
3   If the implementation supports negative zeros, they shall be generated only by:
    -- the &amp;, |, ^, ~, &lt;&lt;, and &gt;&gt; operators with arguments that produce such a value;
    -- the +, -, *, /, and % operators where one argument is a negative zero and the result is
      zero;
    -- compound assignment operators based on the above cases.
    It is unspecified whether these cases actually generate a negative zero or a normal zero,
    and whether a negative zero becomes a normal zero when stored in an object.
4   If the implementation does not support negative zeros, the behavior of the &amp;, |, ^, ~, &lt;&lt;,
    and &gt;&gt; operators with arguments that would produce such a value is undefined.
5   The values of any padding bits are unspecified.<sup><a href="#note45"><b>45)</b></a></sup> A valid (non-trap) object representation

    corresponding unsigned type, and shall represent the same value. For any integer type,
    the object representation where all the bits are zero shall be a representation of the value
    zero in that type.
6   The precision of an integer type is the number of bits it uses to represent values,
    excluding any sign and padding bits. The width of an integer type is the same but
    including any sign bit; thus for unsigned integer types the two values are the same, while

                 Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or
                 equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with
                 signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned
                 integer type.
                 Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent
                 all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then
                 the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

    if an lvalue does not designate an object when it is evaluated, the behavior is undefined.
    When an object is said to have a particular type, the type is specified by the lvalue used to
    designate the object. A modifiable lvalue is an lvalue that does not have array type, does
    not have an incomplete type, does not have a const-qualified type, and if it is a structure
    or union, does not have any member (including, recursively, any member or element of
    all contained aggregates or unions) with a const-qualified type.
2   Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator, the unary &amp; operator, the ++
    operator, the -- operator, or the left operand of the . operator or an assignment operator,
    an lvalue that does not have array type is converted to the value stored in the designated
    object (and is no longer an lvalue). If the lvalue has qualified type, the value has the
    unqualified version of the type of the lvalue; otherwise, the value has the type of the
    lvalue. If the lvalue has an incomplete type and does not have array type, the behavior is
    undefined.

    string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type ''array of type'' is
    converted to an expression with type ''pointer to type'' that points to the initial element of
    the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the
    behavior is undefined.
4   A function designator is an expression that has function type. Except when it is the
    operand of the sizeof operator<sup><a href="#note54"><b>54)</b></a></sup> or the unary &amp; operator, a function designator with
    type ''function returning type'' is converted to an expression that has type ''pointer to

2   Each preprocessing token that is converted to a token shall have the lexical form of a

<b>    Semantics</b>
3   A token is the minimal lexical element of the language in translation phases 7 and 8. The
    categories of tokens are: keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and punctuators.
    A preprocessing token is the minimal lexical element of the language in translation
    phases 3 through 6. The categories of preprocessing tokens are: header names,
    identifiers, preprocessing numbers, character constants, string literals, punctuators, and
    single non-white-space characters that do not lexically match the other preprocessing
    token categories.<sup><a href="#note58"><b>58)</b></a></sup> If a ' or a " character matches the last category, the behavior is
    undefined. Preprocessing tokens can be separated by white space; this consists of
    comments (described later), or white-space characters (space, horizontal tab, new-line,
    vertical tab, and form-feed), or both. As described in <a href="#6.10">6.10</a>, in certain circumstances
    during translation phase 4, white space (or the absence thereof) serves as more than
    preprocessing token separation. White space may appear within a preprocessing token
    only as part of a header name or between the quotation characters in a character constant
    or string literal.



    <sup><a name="note58" href="#note58"><b>58)</b></a></sup> An additional category, placemarkers, is used internally in translation phase 4 (see <a href="#6.10.3.3">6.10.3.3</a>); it cannot
        occur in source files.

[<a name="p49" href="#p49">page 49</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

4   If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a given character, the
    next preprocessing token is the longest sequence of characters that could constitute a
    preprocessing token. There is one exception to this rule: header name preprocessing
    tokens are recognized only within #include preprocessing directives and in
    implementation-defined locations within #pragma directives. In such contexts, a
    sequence of characters that could be either a header name or a string literal is recognized
    as the former.
5   EXAMPLE 1 The program fragment 1Ex is parsed as a preprocessing number token (one that is not a
    valid floating or integer constant token), even though a parse as the pair of preprocessing tokens 1 and Ex
    might produce a valid expression (for example, if Ex were a macro defined as +1). Similarly, the program
    fragment 1E1 is parsed as a preprocessing number (one that is a valid floating constant token), whether or
    not E is a macro name.

6   EXAMPLE 2 The program fragment x+++++y is parsed as x ++ ++ + y, which violates a constraint on
    increment operators, even though the parse x ++ + ++ y might yield a correct expression.

5   As discussed in <a href="#5.2.4.1">5.2.4.1</a>, an implementation may limit the number of significant initial

    linkage) may be more restrictive than that for an internal name (a macro name or an
    identifier that does not have external linkage). The number of significant characters in an

<b>    Description</b>
2   An integer constant begins with a digit, but has no period or exponent part. It may have a
    prefix that specifies its base and a suffix that specifies its type.
3   A decimal constant begins with a nonzero digit and consists of a sequence of decimal
    digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix 0 optionally followed by a sequence of the
    digits 0 through 7 only. A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X followed
    by a sequence of the decimal digits and the letters a (or A) through f (or F) with values
    10 through 15 respectively.
<b>    Semantics</b>
4   The value of a decimal constant is computed base 10; that of an octal constant, base 8;
    that of a hexadecimal constant, base 16. The lexically first digit is the most significant.
5   The type of an integer constant is the first of the corresponding list in which its value can
    be represented.

<b>    Description</b>
2   A floating constant has a significand part that may be followed by an exponent part and a
    suffix that specifies its type. The components of the significand part may include a digit
    sequence representing the whole-number part, followed by a period (.), followed by a
    digit sequence representing the fraction part. The components of the exponent part are an
    e, E, p, or P followed by an exponent consisting of an optionally signed digit sequence.
    Either the whole-number part or the fraction part has to be present; for decimal floating
    constants, either the period or the exponent part has to be present.
<b>    Semantics</b>
3   The significand part is interpreted as a (decimal or hexadecimal) rational number; the
    digit sequence in the exponent part is interpreted as a decimal integer. For decimal
    floating constants, the exponent indicates the power of 10 by which the significand part is
    to be scaled. For hexadecimal floating constants, the exponent indicates the power of 2
    by which the significand part is to be scaled. For decimal floating constants, and also for
    hexadecimal floating constants when FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, the result is either
    the nearest representable value, or the larger or smaller representable value immediately
    adjacent to the nearest representable value, chosen in an implementation-defined manner.
    For hexadecimal floating constants when FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the result is
    correctly rounded.
4   An unsuffixed floating constant has type double. If suffixed by the letter f or F, it has
    type float. If suffixed by the letter l or L, it has type long double.
5   Floating constants are converted to internal format as if at translation-time. The
    conversion of a floating constant shall not raise an exceptional condition or a floating-
    point exception at execution time.
    Recommended practice
6   The implementation should produce a diagnostic message if a hexadecimal constant
    cannot be represented exactly in its evaluation format; the implementation should then
    proceed with the translation of the program.
7   The translation-time conversion of floating constants should match the execution-time
    conversion of character strings by library functions, such as strtod, given matching
    inputs suitable for both conversions, the same result format, and default execution-time
    rounding.<sup><a href="#note64"><b>64)</b></a></sup>




    <sup><a name="note64" href="#note64"><b>64)</b></a></sup> The specification for the library functions recommends more accurate conversion than required for
        floating constants (see <a href="#7.20.1.3">7.20.1.3</a>).

<b>    Description</b>
2   An integer character constant is a sequence of one or more multibyte characters enclosed
    in single-quotes, as in 'x'. A wide character constant is the same, except prefixed by the
    letter L. With a few exceptions detailed later, the elements of the sequence are any
    members of the source character set; they are mapped in an implementation-defined
    manner to members of the execution character set.
3   The single-quote ', the double-quote ", the question-mark ?, the backslash \, and
    arbitrary integer values are representable according to the following table of escape
    sequences:
           single quote '                 \'
           double quote "                 \"
           question mark ?                \?
           backslash \                    \\
           octal character                \octal digits
           hexadecimal character          \x hexadecimal digits
4   The double-quote " and question-mark ? are representable either by themselves or by the
    escape sequences \" and \?, respectively, but the single-quote ' and the backslash \
    shall be represented, respectively, by the escape sequences \' and \\.
5   The octal digits that follow the backslash in an octal escape sequence are taken to be part
    of the construction of a single character for an integer character constant or of a single
    wide character for a wide character constant. The numerical value of the octal integer so
    formed specifies the value of the desired character or wide character.
6   The hexadecimal digits that follow the backslash and the letter x in a hexadecimal escape
    sequence are taken to be part of the construction of a single character for an integer
    character constant or of a single wide character for a wide character constant. The
    numerical value of the hexadecimal integer so formed specifies the value of the desired
    character or wide character.
7   Each octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is the longest sequence of characters that can
    constitute the escape sequence.
8   In addition, characters not in the basic character set are representable by universal
    character names and certain nongraphic characters are representable by escape sequences
    consisting of the backslash \ followed by a lowercase letter: \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t,
    and \v.<sup><a href="#note65"><b>65)</b></a></sup>




    <sup><a name="note65" href="#note65"><b>65)</b></a></sup> The semantics of these characters were discussed in <a href="#5.2.2">5.2.2</a>. If any other character follows a backslash,
        the result is not a token and a diagnostic is required. See ''future language directions'' (<a href="#6.11.4">6.11.4</a>).

[<a name="p60" href="#p60">page 60</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

<b>     Constraints</b>
9    The value of an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence shall be in the range of
     representable values for the type unsigned char for an integer character constant, or
     the unsigned type corresponding to wchar_t for a wide character constant.
<b>     Semantics</b>
10   An integer character constant has type int. The value of an integer character constant
     containing a single character that maps to a single-byte execution character is the
     numerical value of the representation of the mapped character interpreted as an integer.
     The value of an integer character constant containing more than one character (e.g.,
     'ab'), or containing a character or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte
     execution character, is implementation-defined. If an integer character constant contains
     a single character or escape sequence, its value is the one that results when an object with
     type char whose value is that of the single character or escape sequence is converted to
     type int.
11   A wide character constant has type wchar_t, an integer type defined in the
     <a href="#7.17">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</a> header. The value of a wide character constant containing a single
     multibyte character that maps to a member of the extended execution character set is the
     wide character corresponding to that multibyte character, as defined by the mbtowc
     function, with an implementation-defined current locale. The value of a wide character
     constant containing more than one multibyte character, or containing a multibyte
     character or escape sequence not represented in the extended execution character set, is
     implementation-defined.
12   EXAMPLE 1      The construction '\0' is commonly used to represent the null character.

13   EXAMPLE 2 Consider implementations that use two's-complement representation for integers and eight
     bits for objects that have type char. In an implementation in which type char has the same range of
     values as signed char, the integer character constant '\xFF' has the value -1; if type char has the
     same range of values as unsigned char, the character constant '\xFF' has the value +255.

14   EXAMPLE 3 Even if eight bits are used for objects that have type char, the construction '\x123'
     specifies an integer character constant containing only one character, since a hexadecimal escape sequence
     is terminated only by a non-hexadecimal character. To specify an integer character constant containing the
     two characters whose values are '\x12' and '3', the construction '\0223' may be used, since an octal
     escape sequence is terminated after three octal digits. (The value of this two-character integer character
     constant is implementation-defined.)

15   EXAMPLE 4 Even if 12 or more bits are used for objects that have type wchar_t, the construction
     L'\1234' specifies the implementation-defined value that results from the combination of the values
     0123 and '4'.

    multibyte character sequence is treated as a wide string literal; otherwise, it is treated as a
    character string literal.
5   In translation phase 7, a byte or code of value zero is appended to each multibyte
    character sequence that results from a string literal or literals.<sup><a href="#note66"><b>66)</b></a></sup> The multibyte character
    sequence is then used to initialize an array of static storage duration and length just
    sufficient to contain the sequence. For character string literals, the array elements have
    type char, and are initialized with the individual bytes of the multibyte character
    sequence; for wide string literals, the array elements have type wchar_t, and are
    initialized with the sequence of wide characters corresponding to the multibyte character

    not represented in the execution character set is implementation-defined.
6   It is unspecified whether these arrays are distinct provided their elements have the
    appropriate values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is
    undefined.

             "\x12" "3"
    produces a single character string literal containing the two characters whose values are '\x12' and '3',

1   An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies computation of a
    value, or that designates an object or a function, or that generates side effects, or that
    performs a combination thereof.
2   Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
    modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.<sup><a href="#note72"><b>72)</b></a></sup> Furthermore, the prior value
    shall be read only to determine the value to be stored.<sup><a href="#note73"><b>73)</b></a></sup>
3   The grouping of operators and operands is indicated by the syntax.<sup><a href="#note74"><b>74)</b></a></sup> Except as specified
    later (for the function-call (), &amp;&amp;, ||, ?:, and comma operators), the order of evaluation
    of subexpressions and the order in which side effects take place are both unspecified.
4   Some operators (the unary operator ~, and the binary operators &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &amp;, ^, and |,
    collectively described as bitwise operators) are required to have operands that have
    integer type. These operators yield values that depend on the internal representations of
    integers, and have implementation-defined and undefined aspects for signed types.
5   If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an expression (that is, if the
    result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of representable values for its
    type), the behavior is undefined.
6   The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is the declared type of the
    object, if any.<sup><a href="#note75"><b>75)</b></a></sup> If a value is stored into an object having no declared type through an

        <a href="#6.5.1">6.5.1</a> through <a href="#6.5.6">6.5.6</a>. The exceptions are cast expressions (<a href="#6.5.4">6.5.4</a>) as operands of unary operators

        the conditional operator ?: (<a href="#6.5.15">6.5.15</a>).
           Within each major subclause, the operators have the same precedence. Left- or right-associativity is

    memcpy or memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type
    of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the
    value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied, if it has one. For
    all other accesses to an object having no declared type, the effective type of the object is
    simply the type of the lvalue used for the access.
7   An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that has one of
    the following types:<sup><a href="#note76"><b>76)</b></a></sup>
    -- a type compatible with the effective type of the object,

<b>    Constraints</b>
1   One of the expressions shall have type ''pointer to object type'', the other expression shall
    have integer type, and the result has type ''type''.
<b>    Semantics</b>
2   A postfix expression followed by an expression in square brackets [] is a subscripted
    designation of an element of an array object. The definition of the subscript operator []
    is that E1[E2] is identical to (*((E1)+(E2))). Because of the conversion rules that
    apply to the binary + operator, if E1 is an array object (equivalently, a pointer to the
    initial element of an array object) and E2 is an integer, E1[E2] designates the E2-th
    element of E1 (counting from zero).
3   Successive subscript operators designate an element of a multidimensional array object.
    If E is an n-dimensional array (n &gt;= 2) with dimensions i x j x . . . x k, then E (used as
    other than an lvalue) is converted to a pointer to an (n - 1)-dimensional array with
    dimensions j x . . . x k. If the unary * operator is applied to this pointer explicitly, or
    implicitly as a result of subscripting, the result is the pointed-to (n - 1)-dimensional array,
    which itself is converted into a pointer if used as other than an lvalue. It follows from this
    that arrays are stored in row-major order (last subscript varies fastest).
4   EXAMPLE        Consider the array object defined by the declaration
             int x[3][5];
    Here x is a 3 x 5 array of ints; more precisely, x is an array of three element objects, each of which is an
    array of five ints. In the expression x[i], which is equivalent to (*((x)+(i))), x is first converted to
    a pointer to the initial array of five ints. Then i is adjusted according to the type of x, which conceptually
    entails multiplying i by the size of the object to which the pointer points, namely an array of five int
    objects. The results are added and indirection is applied to yield an array of five ints. When used in the
    expression x[i][j], that array is in turn converted to a pointer to the first of the ints, so x[i][j]
    yields an int.

    have type float are promoted to double. These are called the default argument
    promotions. If the number of arguments does not equal the number of parameters, the
    behavior is undefined. If the function is defined with a type that includes a prototype, and
    either the prototype ends with an ellipsis (, ...) or the types of the arguments after
    promotion are not compatible with the types of the parameters, the behavior is undefined.
    If the function is defined with a type that does not include a prototype, and the types of
    the arguments after promotion are not compatible with those of the parameters after
    promotion, the behavior is undefined, except for the following cases:




    <sup><a name="note80" href="#note80"><b>80)</b></a></sup> Most often, this is the result of converting an identifier that is a function designator.
    <sup><a name="note81" href="#note81"><b>81)</b></a></sup> A function may change the values of its parameters, but these changes cannot affect the values of the
        arguments. On the other hand, it is possible to pass a pointer to an object, and the function may
        change the value of the object pointed to. A parameter declared to have array or function type is
        adjusted to have a pointer type as described in <a href="#6.9.1">6.9.1</a>.

     -- one promoted type is a signed integer type, the other promoted type is the
       corresponding unsigned integer type, and the value is representable in both types;
     -- both types are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of a character type or
       void.
7    If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does include a prototype,
     the arguments are implicitly converted, as if by assignment, to the types of the
     corresponding parameters, taking the type of each parameter to be the unqualified version
     of its declared type. The ellipsis notation in a function prototype declarator causes
     argument type conversion to stop after the last declared parameter. The default argument
     promotions are performed on trailing arguments.
8    No other conversions are performed implicitly; in particular, the number and types of
     arguments are not compared with those of the parameters in a function definition that
     does not include a function prototype declarator.
9    If the function is defined with a type that is not compatible with the type (of the
     expression) pointed to by the expression that denotes the called function, the behavior is
     undefined.
10   The order of evaluation of the function designator, the actual arguments, and
     subexpressions within the actual arguments is unspecified, but there is a sequence point
     before the actual call.
11   Recursive function calls shall be permitted, both directly and indirectly through any chain
     of other functions.

     the functions f1, f2, f3, and f4 may be called in any order. All side effects have to be completed before
     the function pointed to by pf[f1()] is called.

5   One special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of unions: if a union contains
    several structures that share a common initial sequence (see below), and if the union
    object currently contains one of these structures, it is permitted to inspect the common
    initial part of any of them anywhere that a declaration of the complete type of the union is
    visible. Two structures share a common initial sequence if corresponding members have
    compatible types (and, for bit-fields, the same widths) for a sequence of one or more
    initial members.
6   EXAMPLE 1 If f is a function returning a structure or union, and x is a member of that structure or
    union, f().x is a valid postfix expression but is not an lvalue.

1   The type name shall specify an object type or an array of unknown size, but not a variable
    length array type.
2   No initializer shall attempt to provide a value for an object not contained within the entire
    unnamed object specified by the compound literal.
3   If the compound literal occurs outside the body of a function, the initializer list shall

<b>    Semantics</b>
4   A postfix expression that consists of a parenthesized type name followed by a brace-
    enclosed list of initializers is a compound literal. It provides an unnamed object whose
    value is given by the initializer list.<sup><a href="#note84"><b>84)</b></a></sup>
5   If the type name specifies an array of unknown size, the size is determined by the
    initializer list as specified in <a href="#6.7.8">6.7.8</a>, and the type of the compound literal is that of the
    completed array type. Otherwise (when the type name specifies an object type), the type
    of the compound literal is that specified by the type name. In either case, the result is an
    lvalue.


    <sup><a name="note84" href="#note84"><b>84)</b></a></sup> Note that this differs from a cast expression. For example, a cast specifies a conversion to scalar types
        or void only, and the result of a cast expression is not an lvalue.

[<a name="p75" href="#p75">page 75</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

6    The value of the compound literal is that of an unnamed object initialized by the
     initializer list. If the compound literal occurs outside the body of a function, the object
     has static storage duration; otherwise, it has automatic storage duration associated with
     the enclosing block.
7    All the semantic rules and constraints for initializer lists in <a href="#6.7.8">6.7.8</a> are applicable to
     compound literals.<sup><a href="#note85"><b>85)</b></a></sup>
8    String literals, and compound literals with const-qualified types, need not designate
     distinct objects.<sup><a href="#note86"><b>86)</b></a></sup>
9    EXAMPLE 1       The file scope definition
              int *p = (int []){2, 4};
     initializes p to point to the first element of an array of two ints, the first having the value two and the
     second, four. The expressions in this compound literal are required to be constant. The unnamed object
     has static storage duration.

10   EXAMPLE 2       In contrast, in
              void f(void)
              {
                    int *p;
                    /*...*/
                    p = (int [2]){*p};
                    /*...*/
              }
     p is assigned the address of the first element of an array of two ints, the first having the value previously
     pointed to by p and the second, zero. The expressions in this compound literal need not be constant. The
     unnamed object has automatic storage duration.

11   EXAMPLE 3 Initializers with designations can be combined with compound literals. Structure objects
     created using compound literals can be passed to functions without depending on member order:
              drawline((struct point){.x=1, .y=1},
                    (struct point){.x=3, .y=4});
     Or, if drawline instead expected pointers to struct point:
              drawline(&amp;(struct point){.x=1, .y=1},
                    &amp;(struct point){.x=3, .y=4});

12   EXAMPLE 4       A read-only compound literal can be specified through constructions like:
              (const float []){1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6}




     <sup><a name="note85" href="#note85"><b>85)</b></a></sup> For example, subobjects without explicit initializers are initialized to zero.
     <sup><a name="note86" href="#note86"><b>86)</b></a></sup> This allows implementations to share storage for string literals and constant compound literals with
         the same or overlapping representations.

[<a name="p76" href="#p76">page 76</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

13   EXAMPLE 5        The following three expressions have different meanings:
              "/tmp/fileXXXXXX"
              (char []){"/tmp/fileXXXXXX"}
              (const char []){"/tmp/fileXXXXXX"}
     The first always has static storage duration and has type array of char, but need not be modifiable; the last
     two have automatic storage duration when they occur within the body of a function, and the first of these
     two is modifiable.

14   EXAMPLE 6 Like string literals, const-qualified compound literals can be placed into read-only memory
     and can even be shared. For example,
              (const char []){"abc"} == "abc"
     might yield 1 if the literals' storage is shared.

15   EXAMPLE 7 Since compound literals are unnamed, a single compound literal cannot specify a circularly
     linked object. For example, there is no way to write a self-referential compound literal that could be used
     as the function argument in place of the named object endless_zeros below:
              struct int_list { int car; struct int_list *cdr; };
              struct int_list endless_zeros = {0, &amp;endless_zeros};
              eval(endless_zeros);

16   EXAMPLE 8        Each compound literal creates only a single object in a given scope:
              struct s { int i; };
              int f (void)
              {
                    struct s *p = 0, *q;
                    int j = 0;
              again:
                    q = p, p = &amp;((struct s){ j++ });
                    if (j &lt; 2) goto again;
                        return p == q &amp;&amp; q-&gt;i == 1;
              }
     The function f() always returns the value 1.
17   Note that if an iteration statement were used instead of an explicit goto and a labeled statement, the
     lifetime of the unnamed object would be the body of the loop only, and on entry next time around p would
     have an indeterminate value, which would result in undefined behavior.

<b>    Semantics</b>
2   The result of the unary + operator is the value of its (promoted) operand. The integer

3   The result of the unary - operator is the negative of its (promoted) operand. The integer

4   The result of the ~ operator is the bitwise complement of its (promoted) operand (that is,

    allocators and I/O systems. A storage-allocation function might accept a size (in bytes) of an object to
    allocate and return a pointer to void. For example:
            extern void *alloc(size_t);
            double *dp = alloc(sizeof *dp);
    The implementation of the alloc function should ensure that its return value is aligned suitably for
    conversion to a pointer to double.

6   EXAMPLE 2      Another use of the sizeof operator is to compute the number of elements in an array:
            sizeof array / sizeof array[0]

7   EXAMPLE 3      In this example, the size of a variable length array is computed and returned from a
    function:
            #include <a href="#7.17">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</a>
            size_t fsize3(int n)
            {
                  char b[n+3];                  // variable length array
                  return sizeof b;              // execution time sizeof
            }



    <sup><a name="note88" href="#note88"><b>88)</b></a></sup> When applied to a parameter declared to have array or function type, the sizeof operator yields the
        size of the adjusted (pointer) type (see <a href="#6.9.1">6.9.1</a>).

4   If both operands have arithmetic type, the usual arithmetic conversions are performed on

5   The result of the binary + operator is the sum of the operands.
6   The result of the binary - operator is the difference resulting from the subtraction of the

7   For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to an object that is not an element of an
    array behaves the same as a pointer to the first element of an array of length one with the
    type of the object as its element type.
8   When an expression that has integer type is added to or subtracted from a pointer, the
    result has the type of the pointer operand. If the pointer operand points to an element of
    an array object, and the array is large enough, the result points to an element offset from
    the original element such that the difference of the subscripts of the resulting and original
    array elements equals the integer expression. In other words, if the expression P points to
    the i-th element of an array object, the expressions (P)+N (equivalently, N+(P)) and
    (P)-N (where N has the value n) point to, respectively, the i+n-th and i-n-th elements of
    the array object, provided they exist. Moreover, if the expression P points to the last
    element of an array object, the expression (P)+1 points one past the last element of the
    array object, and if the expression Q points one past the last element of an array object,
    the expression (Q)-1 points to the last element of the array object. If both the pointer
    operand and the result point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last
    element of the array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the
    behavior is undefined. If the result points one past the last element of the array object, it
    shall not be used as the operand of a unary * operator that is evaluated.
9   When two pointers are subtracted, both shall point to elements of the same array object,
    or one past the last element of the array object; the result is the difference of the
    subscripts of the two array elements. The size of the result is implementation-defined,
    and its type (a signed integer type) is ptrdiff_t defined in the <a href="#7.17">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</a> header.
    If the result is not representable in an object of that type, the behavior is undefined. In
    other words, if the expressions P and Q point to, respectively, the i-th and j-th elements of

    object of type ptrdiff_t. Moreover, if the expression P points either to an element of

     <sup><a name="note91" href="#note91"><b>91)</b></a></sup> Another way to approach pointer arithmetic is first to convert the pointer(s) to character pointer(s): In
         this scheme the integer expression added to or subtracted from the converted pointer is first multiplied
         by the size of the object originally pointed to, and the resulting pointer is converted back to the
         original type. For pointer subtraction, the result of the difference between the character pointers is
         similarly divided by the size of the object originally pointed to.
          When viewed in this way, an implementation need only provide one extra byte (which may overlap
          another object in the program) just after the end of the object in order to satisfy the ''one past the last
          element'' requirements.

<b>    Semantics</b>
2   In simple assignment (=), the value of the right operand is converted to the type of the

3   If the value being stored in an object is read from another object that overlaps in any way

    <sup><a name="note96" href="#note96"><b>96)</b></a></sup> The asymmetric appearance of these constraints with respect to type qualifiers is due to the conversion
        (specified in <a href="#6.3.2.1">6.3.2.1</a>) that changes lvalues to ''the value of the expression'' and thus removes any type
        qualifiers that were applied to the type category of the expression (for example, it removes const but

    negative, so the operands of the comparison can never compare equal. Therefore, for full portability, the
    variable c should be declared as int.

            int i;
            long l;
            l = (c = i);
    the value of i is converted to the type of the assignment expression c = i, that is, char type. The value
    of the expression enclosed in parentheses is then converted to the type of the outer assignment expression,
    that is, long int type.

<b>    Description</b>
2   A constant expression can be evaluated during translation rather than runtime, and
    accordingly may be used in any place that a constant may be.
<b>    Constraints</b>
3   Constant expressions shall not contain assignment, increment, decrement, function-call,

4   Each constant expression shall evaluate to a constant that is in the range of representable

<b>    Semantics</b>
5   An expression that evaluates to a constant is required in several contexts. If a floating
    expression is evaluated in the translation environment, the arithmetic precision and range
    shall be at least as great as if the expression were being evaluated in the execution
    environment.

    expressions whose results are integer constants, and floating constants that are the
    immediate operands of casts. Cast operators in an integer constant expression shall only
    convert arithmetic types to integer types, except as part of an operand to the sizeof
    operator.
7   More latitude is permitted for constant expressions in initializers. Such a constant
    expression shall be, or evaluate to, one of the following:
    -- an arithmetic constant expression,
    -- a null pointer constant,




    <sup><a name="note98" href="#note98"><b>98)</b></a></sup> The operand of a sizeof operator is usually not evaluated (<a href="#6.5.3.4">6.5.3.4</a>).

8    An arithmetic constant expression shall have arithmetic type and shall only have
     operands that are integer constants, floating constants, enumeration constants, character
     constants, and sizeof expressions. Cast operators in an arithmetic constant expression
     shall only convert arithmetic types to arithmetic types, except as part of an operand to a
     sizeof operator whose result is an integer constant.
9    An address constant is a null pointer, a pointer to an lvalue designating an object of static
     storage duration, or a pointer to a function designator; it shall be created explicitly using
     the unary &amp; operator or an integer constant cast to pointer type, or implicitly by the use of
     an expression of array or function type. The array-subscript [] and member-access .

<b>     Semantics</b>
5    As discussed in <a href="#6.2.5">6.2.5</a>, a structure is a type consisting of a sequence of members, whose
     storage is allocated in an ordered sequence, and a union is a type consisting of a sequence
     of members whose storage overlap.
6    Structure and union specifiers have the same form. The keywords struct and union
     indicate that the type being specified is, respectively, a structure type or a union type.
7    The presence of a struct-declaration-list in a struct-or-union-specifier declares a new type,
     within a translation unit. The struct-declaration-list is a sequence of declarations for the
     members of the structure or union. If the struct-declaration-list contains no named
     members, the behavior is undefined. The type is incomplete until after the } that
     terminates the list.
8    A member of a structure or union may have any object type other than a variably
     modified type.<sup><a href="#note105"><b>105)</b></a></sup> In addition, a member may be declared to consist of a specified
     number of bits (including a sign bit, if any). Such a member is called a bit-field;<sup><a href="#note106"><b>106)</b></a></sup> its
     width is preceded by a colon.
9    A bit-field is interpreted as a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the specified
     number of bits.<sup><a href="#note107"><b>107)</b></a></sup> If the value 0 or 1 is stored into a nonzero-width bit-field of type
     _Bool, the value of the bit-field shall compare equal to the value stored.
10   An implementation may allocate any addressable storage unit large enough to hold a bit-
     field. If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows another bit-field in a
     structure shall be packed into adjacent bits of the same unit. If insufficient space remains,
     whether a bit-field that does not fit is put into the next unit or overlaps adjacent units is
     implementation-defined. The order of allocation of bit-fields within a unit (high-order to
     low-order or low-order to high-order) is implementation-defined. The alignment of the
     addressable storage unit is unspecified.
11   A bit-field declaration with no declarator, but only a colon and a width, indicates an
     unnamed bit-field.<sup><a href="#note108"><b>108)</b></a></sup> As a special case, a bit-field structure member with a width of 0
     indicates that no further bit-field is to be packed into the unit in which the previous bit-
     field, if any, was placed.


     <sup><a name="note105" href="#note105"><b>105)</b></a></sup> A structure or union can not contain a member with a variably modified type because member names
          are not ordinary identifiers as defined in <a href="#6.2.3">6.2.3</a>.
     <sup><a name="note106" href="#note106"><b>106)</b></a></sup> The unary &amp; (address-of) operator cannot be applied to a bit-field object; thus, there are no pointers to
          or arrays of bit-field objects.
     <sup><a name="note107" href="#note107"><b>107)</b></a></sup> As specified in <a href="#6.7.2">6.7.2</a> above, if the actual type specifier used is int or a typedef-name defined as int,
          then it is implementation-defined whether the bit-field is signed or unsigned.
     <sup><a name="note108" href="#note108"><b>108)</b></a></sup> An unnamed bit-field structure member is useful for padding to conform to externally imposed
          layouts.

[<a name="p102" href="#p102">page 102</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

12   Each non-bit-field member of a structure or union object is aligned in an implementation-
     defined manner appropriate to its type.
13   Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the units in which bit-fields
     reside have addresses that increase in the order in which they are declared. A pointer to a
     structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial member (or if that member is a
     bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa. There may be unnamed
     padding within a structure object, but not at its beginning.
14   The size of a union is sufficient to contain the largest of its members. The value of at
     most one of the members can be stored in a union object at any time. A pointer to a
     union object, suitably converted, points to each of its members (or if a member is a bit-
     field, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa.
15   There may be unnamed padding at the end of a structure or union.
16   As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one named member may
     have an incomplete array type; this is called a flexible array member. In most situations,
     the flexible array member is ignored. In particular, the size of the structure is as if the
     flexible array member were omitted except that it may have more trailing padding than
     the omission would imply. However, when a . (or -&gt;) operator has a left operand that is
     (a pointer to) a structure with a flexible array member and the right operand names that
     member, it behaves as if that member were replaced with the longest array (with the same
     element type) that would not make the structure larger than the object being accessed; the
     offset of the array shall remain that of the flexible array member, even if this would differ
     from that of the replacement array. If this array would have no elements, it behaves as if
     it had one element but the behavior is undefined if any attempt is made to access that
     element or to generate a pointer one past it.
17   EXAMPLE       After the declaration:
             struct s { int n; double d[]; };
     the structure struct s has a flexible array member d. A typical way to use this is:
             int m = /* some value */;
             struct s *p = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + sizeof (double [m]));
     and assuming that the call to malloc succeeds, the object pointed to by p behaves, for most purposes, as if
     p had been declared as:
             struct { int n; double d[m]; } *p;
     (there are circumstances in which this equivalence is broken; in particular, the offsets of member d might
     not be the same).
18   Following the above declaration:

[<a name="p103" href="#p103">page 103</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

              struct s t1 = { 0 };                        //   valid
              struct s t2 = { 1, { <a href="#4.2">4.2</a> }};                //   invalid
              t1.n = 4;                                   //   valid
              t1.d[0] = <a href="#4.2">4.2</a>;                              //   might be undefined behavior
     The initialization of t2 is invalid (and violates a constraint) because struct s is treated as if it did not
     contain member d. The assignment to t1.d[0] is probably undefined behavior, but it is possible that
              sizeof (struct s) &gt;= offsetof(struct s, d) + sizeof (double)
     in which case the assignment would be legitimate. Nevertheless, it cannot appear in strictly conforming
     code.
19   After the further declaration:
              struct ss { int n; };
     the expressions:
              sizeof (struct s) &gt;= sizeof (struct ss)
              sizeof (struct s) &gt;= offsetof(struct s, d)
     are always equal to 1.
20   If sizeof (double) is 8, then after the following code is executed:
              struct s *s1;
              struct s *s2;
              s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 64);
              s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 46);
     and assuming that the calls to malloc succeed, the objects pointed to by s1 and s2 behave, for most
     purposes, as if the identifiers had been declared as:
              struct { int n; double d[8]; } *s1;
              struct { int n; double d[5]; } *s2;
21   Following the further successful assignments:
              s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 10);
              s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 6);
     they then behave as if the declarations were:
              struct { int n; double d[1]; } *s1, *s2;
     and:
              double *dp;
              dp = &amp;(s1-&gt;d[0]);           //   valid
              *dp = 42;                   //   valid
              dp = &amp;(s2-&gt;d[0]);           //   valid
              *dp = 42;                   //   undefined behavior
22   The assignment:
              *s1 = *s2;
     only copies the member n; if any of the array elements are within the first sizeof (struct s) bytes
     of the structure, they might be copied or simply overwritten with indeterminate values.

    adding 1 to the value of the previous enumeration constant. (The use of enumerators with
    = may produce enumeration constants with values that duplicate other values in the same
    enumeration.) The enumerators of an enumeration are also known as its members.

                    struct tnode *left, *right;
              };
     specifies a structure that contains an integer and two pointers to objects of the same type. Once this
     declaration has been given, the declaration
              struct tnode s, *sp;
     declares s to be an object of the given type and sp to be a pointer to an object of the given type. With
     these declarations, the expression sp-&gt;left refers to the left struct tnode pointer of the object to
     which sp points; the expression s.right-&gt;count designates the count member of the right struct
     tnode pointed to from s.
11   The following alternative formulation uses the typedef mechanism:




     <sup><a name="note112" href="#note112"><b>112)</b></a></sup> If there is no identifier, the type can, within the translation unit, only be referred to by the declaration
          of which it is a part. Of course, when the declaration is of a typedef name, subsequent declarations
          can make use of that typedef name to declare objects having the specified structure, union, or

     D2. To eliminate this context sensitivity, the declaration
              struct s2;
     may be inserted ahead of D1. This declares a new tag s2 in the inner scope; the declaration D2 then
     completes the specification of the new type.

4    If the same qualifier appears more than once in the same specifier-qualifier-list, either

     once.




     <sup><a name="note114" href="#note114"><b>114)</b></a></sup> The implementation may place a const object that is not volatile in a read-only region of

5    If an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a const-qualified type through use
     of an lvalue with non-const-qualified type, the behavior is undefined. If an attempt is

     with non-volatile-qualified type, the behavior is undefined.<sup><a href="#note115"><b>115)</b></a></sup>
6    An object that has volatile-qualified type may be modified in ways unknown to the
     implementation or have other unknown side effects. Therefore any expression referring
     to such an object shall be evaluated strictly according to the rules of the abstract machine,
     as described in <a href="#5.1.2.3">5.1.2.3</a>. Furthermore, at every sequence point the value last stored in the

     unknown factors mentioned previously.<sup><a href="#note116"><b>116)</b></a></sup> What constitutes an access to an object that

7    An object that is accessed through a restrict-qualified pointer has a special association
     with that pointer. This association, defined in <a href="#6.7.3.1">6.7.3.1</a> below, requires that all accesses to
     that object use, directly or indirectly, the value of that particular pointer.<sup><a href="#note117"><b>117)</b></a></sup> The intended
     use of the restrict qualifier (like the register storage class) is to promote
     optimization, and deleting all instances of the qualifier from all preprocessing translation
     units composing a conforming program does not change its meaning (i.e., observable
     behavior).
8    If the specification of an array type includes any type qualifiers, the element type is so-
     qualified, not the array type. If the specification of a function type includes any type
     qualifiers, the behavior is undefined.<sup><a href="#note118"><b>118)</b></a></sup>
9    For two qualified types to be compatible, both shall have the identically qualified version
     of a compatible type; the order of type qualifiers within a list of specifiers or qualifiers
     does not affect the specified type.
10   EXAMPLE 1       An object declared

     <sup><a name="note115" href="#note115"><b>115)</b></a></sup> This applies to those objects that behave as if they were defined with qualified types, even if they are
          never actually defined as objects in the program (such as an object at a memory-mapped input/output
          address).
     <sup><a name="note116" href="#note116"><b>116)</b></a></sup> A volatile declaration may be used to describe an object corresponding to a memory-mapped
          input/output port or an object accessed by an asynchronously interrupting function. Actions on

          permitted by the rules for evaluating expressions.
     <sup><a name="note117" href="#note117"><b>117)</b></a></sup> For example, a statement that assigns a value returned by malloc to a single pointer establishes this

11   EXAMPLE 2 The following declarations and expressions illustrate the behavior when type qualifiers
     modify an aggregate type:
             const struct s { int mem; } cs = { 1 };
             struct s ncs; // the object ncs is modifiable
             typedef int A[2][3];
             const A a = {{4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}; // array of array of const int
             int *pi;

             pi = &amp;ncs.mem;        //   valid
             pi = &amp;cs.mem;         //   violates type constraints for =
             pci = &amp;cs.mem;        //   valid

<a name="6.7.3.1" href="#6.7.3.1"><b>     6.7.3.1 Formal definition of restrict</b></a>
1    Let D be a declaration of an ordinary identifier that provides a means of designating an
     object P as a restrict-qualified pointer to type T.
2    If D appears inside a block and does not have storage class extern, let B denote the
     block. If D appears in the list of parameter declarations of a function definition, let B
     denote the associated block. Otherwise, let B denote the block of main (or the block of
     whatever function is called at program startup in a freestanding environment).
3    In what follows, a pointer expression E is said to be based on object P if (at some
     sequence point in the execution of B prior to the evaluation of E) modifying P to point to
     a copy of the array object into which it formerly pointed would change the value of E.<sup><a href="#note119"><b>119)</b></a></sup>
     Note that ''based'' is defined only for expressions with pointer types.
4    During each execution of B, let L be any lvalue that has &amp;L based on P. If L is used to
     access the value of the object X that it designates, and X is also modified (by any means),
     then the following requirements apply: T shall not be const-qualified. Every other lvalue
     used to access the value of X shall also have its address based on P. Every access that
     modifies X shall be considered also to modify P, for the purposes of this subclause. If P
     is assigned the value of a pointer expression E that is based on another restricted pointer
     object P2, associated with block B2, then either the execution of B2 shall begin before
     the execution of B, or the execution of B2 shall end prior to the assignment. If these
     requirements are not met, then the behavior is undefined.
5    Here an execution of B means that portion of the execution of the program that would
     correspond to the lifetime of an object with scalar type and automatic storage duration

     <sup><a name="note119" href="#note119"><b>119)</b></a></sup> In other words, E depends on the value of P itself rather than on the value of an object referenced
          indirectly through P. For example, if identifier p has type (int **restrict), then the pointer
          expressions p and p+1 are based on the restricted pointer object designated by p, but the pointer
          expressions *p and p[1] are not.

     associated with B.
6    A translator is free to ignore any or all aliasing implications of uses of restrict.
7    EXAMPLE 1       The file scope declarations
              int * restrict a;
              int * restrict b;
              extern int c[];
     assert that if an object is accessed using one of a, b, or c, and that object is modified anywhere in the
     program, then it is never accessed using either of the other two.

8    EXAMPLE 2 The function parameter declarations in the following example
             void f(int n, int * restrict p, int * restrict q)
             {
                   while (n-- &gt; 0)
                         *p++ = *q++;
             }
     assert that, during each execution of the function, if an object is accessed through one of the pointer
     parameters, then it is not also accessed through the other.
9    The benefit of the restrict qualifiers is that they enable a translator to make an effective dependence
     analysis of function f without examining any of the calls of f in the program. The cost is that the
     programmer has to examine all of those calls to ensure that none give undefined behavior. For example, the
     second call of f in g has undefined behavior because each of d[1] through d[49] is accessed through
     both p and q.
             void g(void)
             {
                   extern int d[100];
                   f(50, d + 50, d); // valid
                   f(50, d + 1, d); // undefined behavior
             }

10   EXAMPLE 3       The function parameter declarations
             void h(int n, int * restrict p, int * restrict q, int * restrict r)
             {
                   int i;
                   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
                          p[i] = q[i] + r[i];
             }
     illustrate how an unmodified object can be aliased through two restricted pointers. In particular, if a and b
     are disjoint arrays, a call of the form h(100, a, b, b) has defined behavior, because array b is not
     modified within function h.

11   EXAMPLE 4 The rule limiting assignments between restricted pointers does not distinguish between a
     function call and an equivalent nested block. With one exception, only ''outer-to-inner'' assignments
     between restricted pointers declared in nested blocks have defined behavior.

[<a name="p111" href="#p111">page 111</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

              {
                       int * restrict p1;
                       int * restrict q1;
                       p1 = q1; // undefined behavior
                       {
                             int * restrict p2 = p1; // valid
                             int * restrict q2 = q1; // valid
                             p1 = q2;                // undefined behavior
                             p2 = q2;                // undefined behavior
                       }
              }
12   The one exception allows the value of a restricted pointer to be carried out of the block in which it (or, more
     precisely, the ordinary identifier used to designate it) is declared when that block finishes execution. For
     example, this permits new_vector to return a vector.
              typedef struct { int n; float * restrict v; } vector;
              vector new_vector(int n)
              {
                    vector t;
                    t.n = n;
                    t.v = malloc(n * sizeof (float));
                    return t;
              }

<b>     Syntax</b>
1             function-specifier:
                     inline
<b>     Constraints</b>
2    Function specifiers shall be used only in the declaration of an identifier for a function.
3    An inline definition of a function with external linkage shall not contain a definition of a
     modifiable object with static storage duration, and shall not contain a reference to an
     identifier with internal linkage.
4    In a hosted environment, the inline function specifier shall not appear in a declaration
     of main.
<b>     Semantics</b>
5    A function declared with an inline function specifier is an inline function. The
     function specifier may appear more than once; the behavior is the same as if it appeared
     only once. Making a function an inline function suggests that calls to the function be as
     fast as possible.<sup><a href="#note120"><b>120)</b></a></sup> The extent to which such suggestions are effective is
     implementation-defined.<sup><a href="#note121"><b>121)</b></a></sup>
6    Any function with internal linkage can be an inline function. For a function with external
     linkage, the following restrictions apply: If a function is declared with an inline

[<a name="p112" href="#p112">page 112</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    function specifier, then it shall also be defined in the same translation unit. If all of the
    file scope declarations for a function in a translation unit include the inline function
    specifier without extern, then the definition in that translation unit is an inline
    definition. An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function,
    and does not forbid an external definition in another translation unit. An inline definition
    provides an alternative to an external definition, which a translator may use to implement
    any call to the function in the same translation unit. It is unspecified whether a call to the
    function uses the inline definition or the external definition.<sup><a href="#note122"><b>122)</b></a></sup>
7   EXAMPLE The declaration of an inline function with external linkage can result in either an external
    definition, or a definition available for use only within the translation unit. A file scope declaration with
    extern creates an external definition. The following example shows an entire translation unit.
             inline double fahr(double t)
             {
                   return (9.0 * t) / 5.0 + 32.0;
             }
             inline double cels(double t)
             {
                   return (5.0 * (t - 32.0)) / 9.0;
             }
             extern double fahr(double);                  // creates an external definition
             double convert(int is_fahr, double temp)
             {
                   /* A translator may perform inline substitutions */
                   return is_fahr ? cels(temp) : fahr(temp);
             }
8   Note that the definition of fahr is an external definition because fahr is also declared with extern, but
    the definition of cels is an inline definition. Because cels has external linkage and is referenced, an
    external definition has to appear in another translation unit (see <a href="#6.9">6.9</a>); the inline definition and the external
    definition are distinct and either may be used for the call.

    <sup><a name="note120" href="#note120"><b>120)</b></a></sup> By using, for example, an alternative to the usual function call mechanism, such as ''inline
         substitution''. Inline substitution is not textual substitution, nor does it create a new function.
         Therefore, for example, the expansion of a macro used within the body of the function uses the
         definition it had at the point the function body appears, and not where the function is called; and
         identifiers refer to the declarations in scope where the body occurs. Likewise, the function has a
         single address, regardless of the number of inline definitions that occur in addition to the external
         definition.
    <sup><a name="note121" href="#note121"><b>121)</b></a></sup> For example, an implementation might never perform inline substitution, or might only perform inline

         corresponding inline definitions in other translation units, all corresponding objects with static storage
         duration are also distinct in each of the definitions.

<b>    Semantics</b>
2   Each declarator declares one identifier, and asserts that when an operand of the same
    form as the declarator appears in an expression, it designates a function or object with the
    scope, storage duration, and type indicated by the declaration specifiers.
3   A full declarator is a declarator that is not part of another declarator. The end of a full
    declarator is a sequence point. If, in the nested sequence of declarators in a full

[<a name="p114" href="#p114">page 114</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    declarator, there is a declarator specifying a variable length array type, the type specified
    by the full declarator is said to be variably modified. Furthermore, any type derived by
    declarator type derivation from a variably modified type is itself variably modified.
4   In the following subclauses, consider a declaration
            T D1
    where T contains the declaration specifiers that specify a type T (such as int) and D1 is
    a declarator that contains an identifier ident. The type specified for the identifier ident in
    the various forms of declarator is described inductively using this notation.
5   If, in the declaration ''T D1'', D1 has the form
            identifier
    then the type specified for ident is T .
6   If, in the declaration ''T D1'', D1 has the form
            ( D )
    then ident has the type specified by the declaration ''T D''. Thus, a declarator in
    parentheses is identical to the unparenthesized declarator, but the binding of complicated
    declarators may be altered by parentheses.
    Implementation limits
7   As discussed in <a href="#5.2.4.1">5.2.4.1</a>, an implementation may limit the number of pointer, array, and

    directly or via one or more typedefs.

    (See <a href="#6.7.5.3">6.7.5.3</a> for the meaning of the optional type qualifiers and the keyword static.)
4   If the size is not present, the array type is an incomplete type. If the size is * instead of
    being an expression, the array type is a variable length array type of unspecified size,

6   For two array types to be compatible, both shall have compatible element types, and if

1    A function declarator shall not specify a return type that is a function type or an array
     type.
2    The only storage-class specifier that shall occur in a parameter declaration is register.
3    An identifier list in a function declarator that is not part of a definition of that function

     and the type specified for ident in the declaration ''T D'' is ''derived-declarator-type-list
     T '', then the type specified for ident is ''derived-declarator-type-list function returning
     T ''.
6    A parameter type list specifies the types of, and may declare identifiers for, the
     parameters of the function.
7    A declaration of a parameter as ''array of type'' shall be adjusted to ''qualified pointer to
     type'', where the type qualifiers (if any) are those specified within the [ and ] of the
     array type derivation. If the keyword static also appears within the [ and ] of the
     array type derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the corresponding
     actual argument shall provide access to the first element of an array with at least as many
     elements as specified by the size expression.
8    A declaration of a parameter as ''function returning type'' shall be adjusted to ''pointer to
     function returning type'', as in <a href="#6.3.2.1">6.3.2.1</a>.
9    If the list terminates with an ellipsis (, ...), no information about the number or types
     of the parameters after the comma is supplied.<sup><a href="#note125"><b>125)</b></a></sup>
10   The special case of an unnamed parameter of type void as the only item in the list
     specifies that the function has no parameters.
11   If, in a parameter declaration, an identifier can be treated either as a typedef name or as a
     parameter name, it shall be taken as a typedef name.
12   If the function declarator is not part of a definition of that function, parameters may have
     incomplete type and may use the [*] notation in their sequences of declarator specifiers
     to specify variable length array types.
13   The storage-class specifier in the declaration specifiers for a parameter declaration, if
     present, is ignored unless the declared parameter is one of the members of the parameter
     type list for a function definition.
14   An identifier list declares only the identifiers of the parameters of the function. An empty
     list in a function declarator that is part of a definition of that function specifies that the
     function has no parameters. The empty list in a function declarator that is not part of a
     definition of that function specifies that no information about the number or types of the
     parameters is supplied.<sup><a href="#note126"><b>126)</b></a></sup>

     Moreover, the parameter type lists, if both are present, shall agree in the number of
     parameters and in use of the ellipsis terminator; corresponding parameters shall have
     compatible types. If one type has a parameter type list and the other type is specified by a
     function declarator that is not part of a function definition and that contains an empty
     identifier list, the parameter list shall not have an ellipsis terminator and the type of each
     parameter shall be compatible with the type that results from the application of the
     default argument promotions. If one type has a parameter type list and the other type is
     specified by a function definition that contains a (possibly empty) identifier list, both shall
     agree in the number of parameters, and the type of each prototype parameter shall be
     compatible with the type that results from the application of the default argument
     promotions to the type of the corresponding identifier. (In the determination of type
     compatibility and of a composite type, each parameter declared with function or array
     type is taken as having the adjusted type and each parameter declared with qualified type
     is taken as having the unqualified version of its declared type.)
16   EXAMPLE 1       The declaration
              int f(void), *fip(), (*pfi)();
     declares a function f with no parameters returning an int, a function fip with no parameter specification
     returning a pointer to an int, and a pointer pfi to a function with no parameter specification returning an
     int. It is especially useful to compare the last two. The binding of *fip() is *(fip()), so that the
     declaration suggests, and the same construction in an expression requires, the calling of a function fip,
     and then using indirection through the pointer result to yield an int. In the declarator (*pfi)(), the
     extra parentheses are necessary to indicate that indirection through a pointer to a function yields a function
     designator, which is then used to call the function; it returns an int.
17   If the declaration occurs outside of any function, the identifiers have file scope and external linkage. If the
     declaration occurs inside a function, the identifiers of the functions f and fip have block scope and either
     internal or external linkage (depending on what file scope declarations for these identifiers are visible), and
     the identifier of the pointer pfi has block scope and no linkage.

18   EXAMPLE 2       The declaration
              int (*apfi[3])(int *x, int *y);
     declares an array apfi of three pointers to functions returning int. Each of these functions has two
     parameters that are pointers to int. The identifiers x and y are declared for descriptive purposes only and
     go out of scope at the end of the declaration of apfi.

19   EXAMPLE 3       The declaration
              int (*fpfi(int (*)(long), int))(int, ...);
     declares a function fpfi that returns a pointer to a function returning an int. The function fpfi has two
     parameters: a pointer to a function returning an int (with one parameter of type long int), and an int.
     The pointer returned by fpfi points to a function that has one int parameter and accepts zero or more
     additional arguments of any type.

                    identifier
<b>    Constraints</b>
2   If a typedef name specifies a variably modified type then it shall have block scope.
<b>    Semantics</b>
3   In a declaration whose storage-class specifier is typedef, each declarator defines an
    identifier to be a typedef name that denotes the type specified for the identifier in the way
    described in <a href="#6.7.5">6.7.5</a>. Any array size expressions associated with variable length array
    declarators are evaluated each time the declaration of the typedef name is reached in the
    order of execution. A typedef declaration does not introduce a new type, only a
    synonym for the type so specified. That is, in the following declarations:
             typedef T type_ident;
             type_ident D;
    type_ident is defined as a typedef name with the type specified by the declaration
    specifiers in T (known as T ), and the identifier in D has the type ''derived-declarator-
    type-list T '' where the derived-declarator-type-list is specified by the declarators of D. A
    typedef name shares the same name space as other identifiers declared in ordinary
    declarators.
4   EXAMPLE 1       After
             typedef int MILES, KLICKSP();
             typedef struct { double hi, lo; } range;
    the constructions
             MILES distance;
             extern KLICKSP *metricp;
             range x;
             range z, *zp;
    are all valid declarations. The type of distance is int, that of metricp is ''pointer to function with no
    parameter specification returning int'', and that of x and z is the specified structure; zp is a pointer to
    such a structure. The object distance has a type compatible with any other int object.

5   EXAMPLE 2       After the declarations
             typedef struct s1 { int x; } t1, *tp1;
             typedef struct s2 { int x; } t2, *tp2;
    type t1 and the type pointed to by tp1 are compatible. Type t1 is also compatible with type struct
    s1, but not compatible with the types struct s2, t2, the type pointed to by tp2, or int.

6   EXAMPLE 3       The following obscure constructions
            typedef signed int t;

                  unsigned t:4;
                  const t:5;
                  plain r:5;
            };
    declare a typedef name t with type signed int, a typedef name plain with type int, and a structure
    with three bit-field members, one named t that contains values in the range [0, 15], an unnamed const-
    qualified bit-field which (if it could be accessed) would contain values in either the range [-15, +15] or
    [-16, +15], and one named r that contains values in one of the ranges [0, 31], [-15, +15], or [-16, +15].
    (The choice of range is implementation-defined.) The first two bit-field declarations differ in that
    unsigned is a type specifier (which forces t to be the name of a structure member), while const is a
    type qualifier (which modifies t which is still visible as a typedef name). If these declarations are followed
    in an inner scope by
            t f(t (t));
            long t;
    then a function f is declared with type ''function returning signed int with one unnamed parameter
    with type pointer to function returning signed int with one unnamed parameter with type signed
    int'', and an identifier t with type long int.

7   EXAMPLE 4 On the other hand, typedef names can be used to improve code readability. All three of the
    following declarations of the signal function specify exactly the same type, the first without making use
    of any typedef names.
            typedef void fv(int), (*pfv)(int);
            void (*signal(int, void (*)(int)))(int);
            fv *signal(int, fv *);
            pfv signal(int, pfv);

8   EXAMPLE 5 If a typedef name denotes a variable length array type, the length of the array is fixed at the
    time the typedef name is defined, not each time it is used:
            void copyt(int n)
            {
                  typedef int B[n];    //               B is n ints, n evaluated now

     Unnamed members of structure objects have indeterminate value even after initialization.
10   If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is
     indeterminate. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly,
     then:
     -- if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;
     -- if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;
     -- if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules;
     -- if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these
       rules.
11   The initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression, optionally enclosed in braces. The
     initial value of the object is that of the expression (after conversion); the same type
     constraints and conversions as for simple assignment apply, taking the type of the scalar
     to be the unqualified version of its declared type.
12   The rest of this subclause deals with initializers for objects that have aggregate or union
     type.
13   The initializer for a structure or union object that has automatic storage duration shall be
     either an initializer list as described below, or a single expression that has compatible
     structure or union type. In the latter case, the initial value of the object, including
     unnamed members, is that of the expression.
14   An array of character type may be initialized by a character string literal, optionally
     enclosed in braces. Successive characters of the character string literal (including the
     terminating null character if there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the
     elements of the array.
15   An array with element type compatible with wchar_t may be initialized by a wide
     string literal, optionally enclosed in braces. Successive wide characters of the wide string
     literal (including the terminating null wide character if there is room or if the array is of
     unknown size) initialize the elements of the array.
16   Otherwise, the initializer for an object that has aggregate or union type shall be a brace-
     enclosed list of initializers for the elements or named members.
17   Each brace-enclosed initializer list has an associated current object. When no
     designations are present, subobjects of the current object are initialized in order according
     to the type of the current object: array elements in increasing subscript order, structure

[<a name="p126" href="#p126">page 126</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

     members in declaration order, and the first named member of a union.<sup><a href="#note129"><b>129)</b></a></sup> In contrast, a
     designation causes the following initializer to begin initialization of the subobject
     described by the designator. Initialization then continues forward in order, beginning
     with the next subobject after that described by the designator.<sup><a href="#note130"><b>130)</b></a></sup>
18   Each designator list begins its description with the current object associated with the
     closest surrounding brace pair. Each item in the designator list (in order) specifies a
     particular member of its current object and changes the current object for the next
     designator (if any) to be that member.<sup><a href="#note131"><b>131)</b></a></sup> The current object that results at the end of the
     designator list is the subobject to be initialized by the following initializer.
19   The initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each initializer provided for a
     particular subobject overriding any previously listed initializer for the same subobject;<sup><a href="#note132"><b>132)</b></a></sup>
     all subobjects that are not initialized explicitly shall be initialized implicitly the same as
     objects that have static storage duration.
20   If the aggregate or union contains elements or members that are aggregates or unions,
     these rules apply recursively to the subaggregates or contained unions. If the initializer of
     a subaggregate or contained union begins with a left brace, the initializers enclosed by
     that brace and its matching right brace initialize the elements or members of the
     subaggregate or the contained union. Otherwise, only enough initializers from the list are
     taken to account for the elements or members of the subaggregate or the first member of
     the contained union; any remaining initializers are left to initialize the next element or
     member of the aggregate of which the current subaggregate or contained union is a part.
21   If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than there are elements or members
     of an aggregate, or fewer characters in a string literal used to initialize an array of known
     size than there are elements in the array, the remainder of the aggregate shall be
     initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static storage duration.
22   If an array of unknown size is initialized, its size is determined by the largest indexed
     element with an explicit initializer. At the end of its initializer list, the array no longer
     has incomplete type.



     <sup><a name="note129" href="#note129"><b>129)</b></a></sup> If the initializer list for a subaggregate or contained union does not begin with a left brace, its
          subobjects are initialized as usual, but the subaggregate or contained union does not become the
          current object: current objects are associated only with brace-enclosed initializer lists.
     <sup><a name="note130" href="#note130"><b>130)</b></a></sup> After a union member is initialized, the next object is not the next member of the union; instead, it is
          the next subobject of an object containing the union.
     <sup><a name="note131" href="#note131"><b>131)</b></a></sup> Thus, a designator can only specify a strict subobject of the aggregate or union that is associated with
          the surrounding brace pair. Note, too, that each separate designator list is independent.
     <sup><a name="note132" href="#note132"><b>132)</b></a></sup> Any initializer for the subobject which is overridden and so not used to initialize that subobject might
          not be evaluated at all.

23   The order in which any side effects occur among the initialization list expressions is
     unspecified.<sup><a href="#note133"><b>133)</b></a></sup>
24   EXAMPLE 1       Provided that <a href="#7.3">&lt;complex.h&gt;</a> has been #included, the declarations
              int i = <a href="#3.5">3.5</a>;
              double complex c = 5 + 3 * I;
     define and initialize i with the value 3 and c with the value 5.0 + i3.0.

25   EXAMPLE 2 The declaration
              int x[] = { 1, 3, 5 };
     defines and initializes x as a one-dimensional array object that has three elements, as no size was specified
     and there are three initializers.

26   EXAMPLE 3       The declaration
              int y[4][3] =         {
                    { 1, 3,         5 },

                    { 3, 5,         7 },
              };
     is a definition with a fully bracketed initialization: 1, 3, and 5 initialize the first row of y (the array object
     y[0]), namely y[0][0], y[0][1], and y[0][2]. Likewise the next two lines initialize y[1] and
     y[2]. The initializer ends early, so y[3] is initialized with zeros. Precisely the same effect could have
     been achieved by
              int y[4][3] = {
                    1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7
              };
     The initializer for y[0] does not begin with a left brace, so three items from the list are used. Likewise the
     next three are taken successively for y[1] and y[2].

27   EXAMPLE 4       The declaration
              int z[4][3] = {
                    { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 }
              };
     initializes the first column of z as specified and initializes the rest with zeros.

28   EXAMPLE 5       The declaration
              struct { int a[3], b; } w[] = { { 1 }, 2 };
     is a definition with an inconsistently bracketed initialization. It defines an array with two element
     structures: w[0].a[0] is 1 and w[1].a[0] is 2; all the other elements are zero.




     <sup><a name="note133" href="#note133"><b>133)</b></a></sup> In particular, the evaluation order need not be the same as the order of subobject initialization.

29   EXAMPLE 6         The declaration
               short q[4][3][2] = {
                     { 1 },
                     { 2, 3 },
                     { 4, 5, 6 }
               };
     contains an incompletely but consistently bracketed initialization. It defines a three-dimensional array
     object: q[0][0][0] is 1, q[1][0][0] is 2, q[1][0][1] is 3, and 4, 5, and 6 initialize
     q[2][0][0], q[2][0][1], and q[2][1][0], respectively; all the rest are zero. The initializer for
     q[0][0] does not begin with a left brace, so up to six items from the current list may be used. There is
     only one, so the values for the remaining five elements are initialized with zero. Likewise, the initializers
     for q[1][0] and q[2][0] do not begin with a left brace, so each uses up to six items, initializing their
     respective two-dimensional subaggregates. If there had been more than six items in any of the lists, a
     diagnostic message would have been issued. The same initialization result could have been achieved by:
               short q[4][3][2] = {
                     1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     4, 5, 6
               };
     or by:
               short q[4][3][2] = {
                     {
                           { 1 },
                     },
                     {
                           { 2, 3 },
                     },
                     {
                           { 4, 5 },
                           { 6 },
                     }
               };
     in a fully bracketed form.
30   Note that the fully bracketed and minimally bracketed forms of initialization are, in general, less likely to
     cause confusion.

31   EXAMPLE 7         One form of initialization that completes array types involves typedef names. Given the
     declaration
               typedef int A[];          // OK - declared with block scope
     the declaration
               A a = { 1, 2 }, b = { 3, 4, 5 };
     is identical to
               int a[] = { 1, 2 }, b[] = { 3, 4, 5 };
     due to the rules for incomplete types.

[<a name="p129" href="#p129">page 129</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

32   EXAMPLE 8       The declaration
              char s[] = "abc", t[3] = "abc";
     defines ''plain'' char array objects s and t whose elements are initialized with character string literals.
     This declaration is identical to
              char s[] = { 'a', 'b', 'c', '\0' },
                   t[] = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
     The contents of the arrays are modifiable. On the other hand, the declaration
              char *p = "abc";
     defines p with type ''pointer to char'' and initializes it to point to an object with type ''array of char''
     with length 4 whose elements are initialized with a character string literal. If an attempt is made to use p to
     modify the contents of the array, the behavior is undefined.

33   EXAMPLE 9       Arrays can be initialized to correspond to the elements of an enumeration by using
     designators:
              enum { member_one,           member_two };
              const char *nm[] =           {
                    [member_two]           = "member two",
                    [member_one]           = "member one",
              };

34   EXAMPLE 10       Structure members can be initialized to nonzero values without depending on their order:
              div_t answer = { .quot = 2, .rem = -1 };

35   EXAMPLE 11 Designators can be used to provide explicit initialization when unadorned initializer lists
     might be misunderstood:
              struct { int a[3], b; } w[] =
                    { [0].a = {1}, [1].a[0] = 2 };

36   EXAMPLE 12       Space can be ''allocated'' from both ends of an array by using a single designator:
              int a[MAX] = {
                    1, 3, 5, 7, 9, [MAX-5] = 8, 6, 4, 2, 0
              };
37   In the above, if MAX is greater than ten, there will be some zero-valued elements in the middle; if it is less
     than ten, some of the values provided by the first five initializers will be overridden by the second five.

38   EXAMPLE 13       Any member of a union can be initialized:
              union { /* ... */ } u = { .any_member = 42 };

<b>    Semantics</b>
4   A switch statement causes control to jump to, into, or past the statement that is the

    default label and the values of any case labels on or in the switch body. A case or
    default label is accessible only within the closest enclosing switch statement.
5   The integer promotions are performed on the controlling expression. The constant
    expression in each case label is converted to the promoted type of the controlling
    expression. If a converted value matches that of the promoted controlling expression,
    control jumps to the statement following the matched case label. Otherwise, if there is
    a default label, control jumps to the labeled statement. If no converted case constant
    expression matches and there is no default label, no part of the switch body is
    executed.

    the object whose identifier is i exists with automatic storage duration (within the block) but is never
    initialized, and thus if the controlling expression has a nonzero value, the call to the printf function will
    access an indeterminate value. Similarly, the call to the function f cannot be reached.

4   An iteration statement causes a statement called the loop body to be executed repeatedly

    whether the loop body is entered from the iteration statement or by a jump.<sup><a href="#note136"><b>136)</b></a></sup>

    of the iteration statement.

2   The storage-class specifiers auto and register shall not appear in the declaration

3   There shall be no more than one external definition for each identifier declared with
    internal linkage in a translation unit. Moreover, if an identifier declared with internal

<b>    Semantics</b>
4   As discussed in <a href="#5.1.1.1">5.1.1.1</a>, the unit of program text after preprocessing is a translation unit,
    which consists of a sequence of external declarations. These are described as ''external''
    because they appear outside any function (and hence have file scope). As discussed in
    <a href="#6.7">6.7</a>, a declaration that also causes storage to be reserved for an object or a function named
    by the identifier is a definition.
5   An external definition is an external declaration that is also a definition of a function
    (other than an inline definition) or an object. If an identifier declared with external
    linkage is used in an expression (other than as part of the operand of a sizeof operator
    whose result is an integer constant), somewhere in the entire program there shall be

<b>     Semantics</b>
7    The declarator in a function definition specifies the name of the function being defined
     and the identifiers of its parameters. If the declarator includes a parameter type list, the
     list also specifies the types of all the parameters; such a declarator also serves as a
     function prototype for later calls to the same function in the same translation unit. If the
     declarator includes an identifier list,<sup><a href="#note142"><b>142)</b></a></sup> the types of the parameters shall be declared in a
     following declaration list. In either case, the type of each parameter is adjusted as
     described in <a href="#6.7.5.3">6.7.5.3</a> for a parameter type list; the resulting type shall be an object type.
8    If a function that accepts a variable number of arguments is defined without a parameter
     type list that ends with the ellipsis notation, the behavior is undefined.
9    Each parameter has automatic storage duration. Its identifier is an lvalue, which is in
     effect declared at the head of the compound statement that constitutes the function body
     (and therefore cannot be redeclared in the function body except in an enclosed block).
     The layout of the storage for parameters is unspecified.
10   On entry to the function, the size expressions of each variably modified parameter are
     evaluated and the value of each argument expression is converted to the type of the
     corresponding parameter as if by assignment. (Array expressions and function
     designators as arguments were converted to pointers before the call.)
11   After all parameters have been assigned, the compound statement that constitutes the
     body of the function definition is executed.
12   If the } that terminates a function is reached, and the value of the function call is used by
     the caller, the behavior is undefined.
13   EXAMPLE 1       In the following:
              extern int max(int a, int b)
              {
                    return a &gt; b ? a : b;
              }
     extern is the storage-class specifier and int is the type specifier; max(int a, int b) is the
     function declarator; and
              { return a &gt; b ? a : b; }
     is the function body. The following similar definition uses the identifier-list form for the parameter
     declarations:

              {
                    return a &gt; b ? a : b;
              }
     Here int a, b; is the declaration list for the parameters. The difference between these two definitions is
     that the first form acts as a prototype declaration that forces conversion of the arguments of subsequent calls
     to the function, whereas the second form does not.

14   EXAMPLE 2           To pass one function to another, one might say
                          int f(void);
                          /* ... */
                          g(f);
     Then the definition of g might read
              void g(int (*funcp)(void))
              {
                    /* ... */

<b>    Description</b>
2   A preprocessing directive consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens that satisfies the
    following constraints: The first token in the sequence is a # preprocessing token that (at
    the start of translation phase 4) is either the first character in the source file (optionally
    after white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows white space
    containing at least one new-line character. The last token in the sequence is the first new-
    line character that follows the first token in the sequence.<sup><a href="#note143"><b>143)</b></a></sup> A new-line character ends
    the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what would otherwise be an

    <sup><a name="note143" href="#note143"><b>143)</b></a></sup> Thus, preprocessing directives are commonly called ''lines''. These ''lines'' have no other syntactic
         significance, as all white space is equivalent except in certain situations during preprocessing (see the
         # character string literal creation operator in <a href="#6.10.3.2">6.10.3.2</a>, for example).

[<a name="p146" href="#p146">page 146</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    invocation of a function-like macro.
3   A text line shall not begin with a # preprocessing token. A non-directive shall not begin
    with any of the directive names appearing in the syntax.
4   When in a group that is skipped (<a href="#6.10.1">6.10.1</a>), the directive syntax is relaxed to allow any
    sequence of preprocessing tokens to occur between the directive name and the following
    new-line character.
<b>    Constraints</b>
5   The only white-space characters that shall appear between preprocessing tokens within a
    preprocessing directive (from just after the introducing # preprocessing token through
    just before the terminating new-line character) are space and horizontal-tab (including
    spaces that have replaced comments or possibly other white-space characters in
    translation phase 3).
<b>    Semantics</b>
6   The implementation can process and skip sections of source files conditionally, include
    other source files, and replace macros. These capabilities are called preprocessing,
    because conceptually they occur before translation of the resulting translation unit.
7   The preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive are not subject to macro
    expansion unless otherwise stated.
8   EXAMPLE        In:
             #define EMPTY
             EMPTY # include &lt;file.h&gt;
    the sequence of preprocessing tokens on the second line is not a preprocessing directive, because it does not
    begin with a # at the start of translation phase 4, even though it will do so after the macro EMPTY has been
    replaced.

<a name="6.10.1" href="#6.10.1"><b>    6.10.1 Conditional inclusion</b></a>
<b>    Constraints</b>
1   The expression that controls conditional inclusion shall be an integer constant expression
    except that: it shall not contain a cast; identifiers (including those lexically identical to
    keywords) are interpreted as described below;<sup><a href="#note144"><b>144)</b></a></sup> and it may contain unary operator
    expressions of the form




    <sup><a name="note144" href="#note144"><b>144)</b></a></sup> Because the controlling constant expression is evaluated during translation phase 4, all identifiers
         either are or are not macro names -- there simply are no keywords, enumeration constants, etc.

[<a name="p147" href="#p147">page 147</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

         defined identifier
    or
         defined ( identifier )
    which evaluate to 1 if the identifier is currently defined as a macro name (that is, if it is
    predefined or if it has been the subject of a #define preprocessing directive without an
    intervening #undef directive with the same subject identifier), 0 if it is not.
2   Each preprocessing token that remains (in the list of preprocessing tokens that will
    become the controlling expression) after all macro replacements have occurred shall be in
    the lexical form of a token (<a href="#6.4">6.4</a>).
<b>    Semantics</b>
3   Preprocessing directives of the forms
         # if   constant-expression new-line groupopt
         # elif constant-expression new-line groupopt
    check whether the controlling constant expression evaluates to nonzero.
4   Prior to evaluation, macro invocations in the list of preprocessing tokens that will become
    the controlling constant expression are replaced (except for those macro names modified
    by the defined unary operator), just as in normal text. If the token defined is
    generated as a result of this replacement process or use of the defined unary operator
    does not match one of the two specified forms prior to macro replacement, the behavior is
    undefined. After all replacements due to macro expansion and the defined unary
    operator have been performed, all remaining identifiers (including those lexically
    identical to keywords) are replaced with the pp-number 0, and then each preprocessing
    token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens compose the controlling constant
    expression which is evaluated according to the rules of <a href="#6.6">6.6</a>. For the purposes of this
    token conversion and evaluation, all signed integer types and all unsigned integer types
    act as if they have the same representation as, respectively, the types intmax_t and
    uintmax_t defined in the header <a href="#7.18">&lt;stdint.h&gt;</a>.<sup><a href="#note145"><b>145)</b></a></sup> This includes interpreting
    character constants, which may involve converting escape sequences into execution
    character set members. Whether the numeric value for these character constants matches
    the value obtained when an identical character constant occurs in an expression (other
    than within a #if or #elif directive) is implementation-defined.<sup><a href="#note146"><b>146)</b></a></sup> Also, whether a
    single-character character constant may have a negative value is implementation-defined.
5   Preprocessing directives of the forms



    <sup><a name="note145" href="#note145"><b>145)</b></a></sup> Thus, on an implementation where INT_MAX is 0x7FFF and UINT_MAX is 0xFFFF, the constant
         0x8000 is signed and positive within a #if expression even though it would be unsigned in
         translation phase 7.

       # ifdef identifier new-line groupopt
       # ifndef identifier new-line groupopt
    check whether the identifier is or is not currently defined as a macro name. Their
    conditions are equivalent to #if defined identifier and #if !defined identifier
    respectively.
6   Each directive's condition is checked in order. If it evaluates to false (zero), the group
    that it controls is skipped: directives are processed only through the name that determines
    the directive in order to keep track of the level of nested conditionals; the rest of the
    directives' preprocessing tokens are ignored, as are the other preprocessing tokens in the
    group. Only the first group whose control condition evaluates to true (nonzero) is
    processed. If none of the conditions evaluates to true, and there is a #else directive, the
    group controlled by the #else is processed; lacking a #else directive, all the groups
    until the #endif are skipped.<sup><a href="#note147"><b>147)</b></a></sup>

<a name="6.10.2" href="#6.10.2"><b>    6.10.2 Source file inclusion</b></a>
<b>    Constraints</b>
1   A #include directive shall identify a header or source file that can be processed by the
    implementation.
<b>    Semantics</b>
2   A preprocessing directive of the form
       # include &lt;h-char-sequence&gt; new-line
    searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by
    the specified sequence between the &lt; and &gt; delimiters, and causes the replacement of that
    directive by the entire contents of the header. How the places are specified or the header
    identified is implementation-defined.
3   A preprocessing directive of the form



    <sup><a name="note146" href="#note146"><b>146)</b></a></sup> Thus, the constant expression in the following #if directive and if statement is not guaranteed to

           #if 'z' - 'a' == 25
           if ('z' - 'a' == 25)

    <sup><a name="note147" href="#note147"><b>147)</b></a></sup> As indicated by the syntax, a preprocessing token shall not follow a #else or #endif directive
         before the terminating new-line character. However, comments may appear anywhere in a source file,
         including within a preprocessing directive.

[<a name="p149" href="#p149">page 149</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

       # include "q-char-sequence" new-line
    causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified
    by the specified sequence between the " delimiters. The named source file is searched
    for in an implementation-defined manner. If this search is not supported, or if the search
    fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read
       # include &lt;h-char-sequence&gt; new-line
    with the identical contained sequence (including &gt; characters, if any) from the original
    directive.
4   A preprocessing directive of the form
       # include pp-tokens new-line
    (that does not match one of the two previous forms) is permitted. The preprocessing
    tokens after include in the directive are processed just as in normal text. (Each
    identifier currently defined as a macro name is replaced by its replacement list of
    preprocessing tokens.) The directive resulting after all replacements shall match one of
    the two previous forms.<sup><a href="#note148"><b>148)</b></a></sup> The method by which a sequence of preprocessing tokens
    between a &lt; and a &gt; preprocessing token pair or a pair of " characters is combined into a
    single header name preprocessing token is implementation-defined.
5   The implementation shall provide unique mappings for sequences consisting of one or
    more nondigits or digits (<a href="#6.4.2.1">6.4.2.1</a>) followed by a period (.) and a single nondigit. The
    first character shall not be a digit. The implementation may ignore distinctions of
    alphabetical case and restrict the mapping to eight significant characters before the
    period.
6   A #include preprocessing directive may appear in a source file that has been read
    because of a #include directive in another file, up to an implementation-defined
    nesting limit (see <a href="#5.2.4.1">5.2.4.1</a>).
7   EXAMPLE 1       The most common uses of #include preprocessing directives are as in the following:
             #include <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>
             #include "myprog.h"

8   EXAMPLE 2       This illustrates macro-replaced #include directives:




    <sup><a name="note148" href="#note148"><b>148)</b></a></sup> Note that adjacent string literals are not concatenated into a single string literal (see the translation
         phases in <a href="#5.1.1.2">5.1.1.2</a>); thus, an expansion that results in two string literals is an invalid directive.

<a name="6.10.3" href="#6.10.3"><b>    6.10.3 Macro replacement</b></a>
<b>    Constraints</b>
1   Two replacement lists are identical if and only if the preprocessing tokens in both have
    the same number, ordering, spelling, and white-space separation, where all white-space
    separations are considered identical.
2   An identifier currently defined as an object-like macro shall not be redefined by another
    #define preprocessing directive unless the second definition is an object-like macro
    definition and the two replacement lists are identical. Likewise, an identifier currently
    defined as a function-like macro shall not be redefined by another #define
    preprocessing directive unless the second definition is a function-like macro definition
    that has the same number and spelling of parameters, and the two replacement lists are
    identical.
3   There shall be white-space between the identifier and the replacement list in the definition
    of an object-like macro.
4   If the identifier-list in the macro definition does not end with an ellipsis, the number of
    arguments (including those arguments consisting of no preprocessing tokens) in an
    invocation of a function-like macro shall equal the number of parameters in the macro
    definition. Otherwise, there shall be more arguments in the invocation than there are
    parameters in the macro definition (excluding the ...). There shall exist a )
    preprocessing token that terminates the invocation.
5   The identifier __VA_ARGS__ shall occur only in the replacement-list of a function-like
    macro that uses the ellipsis notation in the parameters.
6   A parameter identifier in a function-like macro shall be uniquely declared within its
    scope.
<b>    Semantics</b>
7   The identifier immediately following the define is called the macro name. There is one
    name space for macro names. Any white-space characters preceding or following the
    replacement list of preprocessing tokens are not considered part of the replacement list
    for either form of macro.

8    If a # preprocessing token, followed by an identifier, occurs lexically at the point at which
     a preprocessing directive could begin, the identifier is not subject to macro replacement.
9    A preprocessing directive of the form
        # define identifier replacement-list new-line
     defines an object-like macro that causes each subsequent instance of the macro name<sup><a href="#note149"><b>149)</b></a></sup>
     to be replaced by the replacement list of preprocessing tokens that constitute the
     remainder of the directive. The replacement list is then rescanned for more macro names
     as specified below.
10   A preprocessing directive of the form
        # define identifier lparen identifier-listopt ) replacement-list new-line
        # define identifier lparen ... ) replacement-list new-line
        # define identifier lparen identifier-list , ... ) replacement-list new-line
     defines a function-like macro with parameters, whose use is similar syntactically to a
     function call. The parameters are specified by the optional list of identifiers, whose scope
     extends from their declaration in the identifier list until the new-line character that
     terminates the #define preprocessing directive. Each subsequent instance of the
     function-like macro name followed by a ( as the next preprocessing token introduces the
     sequence of preprocessing tokens that is replaced by the replacement list in the definition
     (an invocation of the macro). The replaced sequence of preprocessing tokens is
     terminated by the matching ) preprocessing token, skipping intervening matched pairs of
     left and right parenthesis preprocessing tokens. Within the sequence of preprocessing
     tokens making up an invocation of a function-like macro, new-line is considered a normal
     white-space character.
11   The sequence of preprocessing tokens bounded by the outside-most matching parentheses
     forms the list of arguments for the function-like macro. The individual arguments within
     the list are separated by comma preprocessing tokens, but comma preprocessing tokens
     between matching inner parentheses do not separate arguments. If there are sequences of
     preprocessing tokens within the list of arguments that would otherwise act as
     preprocessing directives,<sup><a href="#note150"><b>150)</b></a></sup> the behavior is undefined.
12   If there is a ... in the identifier-list in the macro definition, then the trailing arguments,
     including any separating comma preprocessing tokens, are merged to form a single item:
     the variable arguments. The number of arguments so combined is such that, following


     <sup><a name="note149" href="#note149"><b>149)</b></a></sup> Since, by macro-replacement time, all character constants and string literals are preprocessing tokens,
          not sequences possibly containing identifier-like subsequences (see <a href="#5.1.1.2">5.1.1.2</a>, translation phases), they
          are never scanned for macro names or parameters.

1   After the arguments for the invocation of a function-like macro have been identified,
    argument substitution takes place. A parameter in the replacement list, unless preceded
    by a # or ## preprocessing token or followed by a ## preprocessing token (see below), is
    replaced by the corresponding argument after all macros contained therein have been
    expanded. Before being substituted, each argument's preprocessing tokens are
    completely macro replaced as if they formed the rest of the preprocessing file; no other
    preprocessing tokens are available.

2   If, in the replacement list, a parameter is immediately preceded by a # preprocessing
    token, both are replaced by a single character string literal preprocessing token that
    contains the spelling of the preprocessing token sequence for the corresponding

    is deleted. Otherwise, the original spelling of each preprocessing token in the argument
    is retained in the character string literal, except for special handling for producing the
    spelling of string literals and character constants: a \ character is inserted before each "
    and \ character of a character constant or string literal (including the delimiting "
    characters), except that it is implementation-defined whether a \ character is inserted
    before the \ character beginning a universal character name. If the replacement that

    list for either form of macro definition.
<b>    Semantics</b>
2   If, in the replacement list of a function-like macro, a parameter is immediately preceded
    or followed by a ## preprocessing token, the parameter is replaced by the corresponding
    argument's preprocessing token sequence; however, if an argument consists of no
    preprocessing tokens, the parameter is replaced by a placemarker preprocessing token
    instead.<sup><a href="#note151"><b>151)</b></a></sup>
3   For both object-like and function-like macro invocations, before the replacement list is
    reexamined for more macro names to replace, each instance of a ## preprocessing token
    in the replacement list (not from an argument) is deleted and the preceding preprocessing
    token is concatenated with the following preprocessing token. Placemarker
    preprocessing tokens are handled specially: concatenation of two placemarkers results in
    a single placemarker preprocessing token, and concatenation of a placemarker with a
    non-placemarker preprocessing token results in the non-placemarker preprocessing token.
    If the result is not a valid preprocessing token, the behavior is undefined. The resulting
    token is available for further macro replacement. The order of evaluation of ## operators
    is unspecified.
4   EXAMPLE       In the following fragment:
            #define     hash_hash # ## #
            #define     mkstr(a) # a
            #define     in_between(a) mkstr(a)
            #define     join(c, d) in_between(c hash_hash d)
            char p[] = join(x, y); // equivalent to
                                   // char p[] = "x ## y";
    The expansion produces, at various stages:
            join(x, y)
            in_between(x hash_hash y)
            in_between(x ## y)
            mkstr(x ## y)
            "x ## y"
    In other words, expanding hash_hash produces a new token, consisting of two adjacent sharp signs, but
    this new token is not the ## operator.


    <sup><a name="note151" href="#note151"><b>151)</b></a></sup> Placemarker preprocessing tokens do not appear in the syntax because they are temporary entities that
         exist only within translation phase 4.

<a name="6.10.3.4" href="#6.10.3.4"><b>    6.10.3.4 Rescanning and further replacement</b></a>
1   After all parameters in the replacement list have been substituted and # and ##
    processing has taken place, all placemarker preprocessing tokens are removed. Then, the
    resulting preprocessing token sequence is rescanned, along with all subsequent
    preprocessing tokens of the source file, for more macro names to replace.
2   If the name of the macro being replaced is found during this scan of the replacement list
    (not including the rest of the source file's preprocessing tokens), it is not replaced.
    Furthermore, if any nested replacements encounter the name of the macro being replaced,
    it is not replaced. These nonreplaced macro name preprocessing tokens are no longer
    available for further replacement even if they are later (re)examined in contexts in which
    that macro name preprocessing token would otherwise have been replaced.
3   The resulting completely macro-replaced preprocessing token sequence is not processed
    as a preprocessing directive even if it resembles one, but all pragma unary operator
    expressions within it are then processed as specified in <a href="#6.10.9">6.10.9</a> below.
<a name="6.10.3.5" href="#6.10.3.5"><b>    6.10.3.5 Scope of macro definitions</b></a>
1   A macro definition lasts (independent of block structure) until a corresponding #undef
    directive is encountered or (if none is encountered) until the end of the preprocessing
    translation unit. Macro definitions have no significance after translation phase 4.
2   A preprocessing directive of the form
       # undef identifier new-line
    causes the specified identifier no longer to be defined as a macro name. It is ignored if
    the specified identifier is not currently defined as a macro name.
3   EXAMPLE 1      The simplest use of this facility is to define a ''manifest constant'', as in
            #define TABSIZE 100
            int table[TABSIZE];

4   EXAMPLE 2 The following defines a function-like macro whose value is the maximum of its arguments.
    It has the advantages of working for any compatible types of the arguments and of generating in-line code
    without the overhead of function calling. It has the disadvantages of evaluating one or the other of its
    arguments a second time (including side effects) and generating more code than a function if invoked
    several times. It also cannot have its address taken, as it has none.
            #define max(a, b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
    The parentheses ensure that the arguments and the resulting expression are bound properly.

<b>    Semantics</b>
1   A unary operator expression of the form:

    is processed as follows: The string literal is destringized by deleting the L prefix, if
    present, deleting the leading and trailing double-quotes, replacing each escape sequence
    \" by a double-quote, and replacing each escape sequence \\ by a single backslash. The
    resulting sequence of characters is processed through translation phase 3 to produce
    preprocessing tokens that are executed as if they were the pp-tokens in a pragma
    directive. The original four preprocessing tokens in the unary operator expression are
    removed.

<a name="7.1.1" href="#7.1.1"><b>    7.1.1 Definitions of terms</b></a>
1   A string is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null
    character. The term multibyte string is sometimes used instead to emphasize special
    processing given to multibyte characters contained in the string or to avoid confusion
    with a wide string. A pointer to a string is a pointer to its initial (lowest addressed)
    character. The length of a string is the number of bytes preceding the null character and
    the value of a string is the sequence of the values of the contained characters, in order.
2   The decimal-point character is the character used by functions that convert floating-point
    numbers to or from character sequences to denote the beginning of the fractional part of
    such character sequences.<sup><a href="#note157"><b>157)</b></a></sup> It is represented in the text and examples by a period, but
    may be changed by the setlocale function.
3   A null wide character is a wide character with code value zero.
4   A wide string is a contiguous sequence of wide characters terminated by and including
    the first null wide character. A pointer to a wide string is a pointer to its initial (lowest
    addressed) wide character. The length of a wide string is the number of wide characters
    preceding the null wide character and the value of a wide string is the sequence of code
    values of the contained wide characters, in order.
5   A shift sequence is a contiguous sequence of bytes within a multibyte string that
    (potentially) causes a change in shift state (see <a href="#5.2.1.2">5.2.1.2</a>). A shift sequence shall not have a
    corresponding wide character; it is instead taken to be an adjunct to an adjacent multibyte
    character.<sup><a href="#note158"><b>158)</b></a></sup>

    <sup><a name="note157" href="#note157"><b>157)</b></a></sup> The functions that make use of the decimal-point character are the numeric conversion functions
         (<a href="#7.20.1">7.20.1</a>, <a href="#7.24.4.1">7.24.4.1</a>) and the formatted input/output functions (<a href="#7.19.6">7.19.6</a>, <a href="#7.24.2">7.24.2</a>).
    <sup><a name="note158" href="#note158"><b>158)</b></a></sup> For state-dependent encodings, the values for MB_CUR_MAX and MB_LEN_MAX shall thus be large
         enough to count all the bytes in any complete multibyte character plus at least one adjacent shift
         sequence of maximum length. Whether these counts provide for more than one shift sequence is the
         implementation's choice.

1   Each header declares or defines all identifiers listed in its associated subclause, and

2   No other identifiers are reserved. If the program declares or defines an identifier in a
    context in which it is reserved (other than as allowed by <a href="#7.1.4">7.1.4</a>), or defines a reserved
    identifier as a macro name, the behavior is undefined.
3   If the program removes (with #undef) any macro definition of an identifier in the first

    or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
    parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a function
    with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined. If a function argument is
    described as being an array, the pointer actually passed to the function shall have a value
    such that all address computations and accesses to objects (that would be valid if the

    the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one
    of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by
    such a macro. Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing
    the name of the function in parentheses, because the name is then not followed by the left
    parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic
    reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as
    a macro.<sup><a href="#note161"><b>161)</b></a></sup> The use of #undef to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an
    actual function is referred to. Any invocation of a library function that is implemented as
    a macro shall expand to code that evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully
    protected by parentheses where necessary, so it is generally safe to use arbitrary
    expressions as arguments.<sup><a href="#note162"><b>162)</b></a></sup> Likewise, those function-like macros described in the
    following subclauses may be invoked in an expression anywhere a function with a
    compatible return type could be called.<sup><a href="#note163"><b>163)</b></a></sup> All object-like macros listed as expanding to
    integer constant expressions shall additionally be suitable for use in #if preprocessing
    directives.
2   Provided that a library function can be declared without reference to any type defined in a
    header, it is also permissible to declare the function and use it without including its
    associated header.
3   There is a sequence point immediately before a library function returns.
4   The functions in the standard library are not guaranteed to be reentrant and may modify
    objects with static storage duration.<sup><a href="#note164"><b>164)</b></a></sup>



    <sup><a name="note161" href="#note161"><b>161)</b></a></sup> This means that an implementation shall provide an actual function for each library function, even if it
         also provides a macro for that function.
    <sup><a name="note162" href="#note162"><b>162)</b></a></sup> Such macros might not contain the sequence points that the corresponding function calls do.
    <sup><a name="note163" href="#note163"><b>163)</b></a></sup> Because external identifiers and some macro names beginning with an underscore are reserved,
         implementations may provide special semantics for such names. For example, the identifier
         _BUILTIN_abs could be used to indicate generation of in-line code for the abs function. Thus, the
         appropriate header could specify
                  #define abs(x) _BUILTIN_abs(x)
         for a compiler whose code generator will accept it.
         In this manner, a user desiring to guarantee that a given library function such as abs will be a genuine
         function may write
                  #undef abs
         whether the implementation's header provides a macro implementation of abs or a built-in
         implementation. The prototype for the function, which precedes and is hidden by any macro
         definition, is thereby revealed also.
    <sup><a name="note164" href="#note164"><b>164)</b></a></sup> Thus, a signal handler cannot, in general, call standard library functions.

<a name="7.5" href="#7.5"><b>    7.5 Errors &lt;errno.h&gt;</b></a>
1   The header <a href="#7.5">&lt;errno.h&gt;</a> defines several macros, all relating to the reporting of error
    conditions.
2   The macros are
             EDOM
             EILSEQ
             ERANGE
    which expand to integer constant expressions with type int, distinct positive values, and
    which are suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives; and
             errno
    which expands to a modifiable lvalue<sup><a href="#note175"><b>175)</b></a></sup> that has type int, the value of which is set to a
    positive error number by several library functions. It is unspecified whether errno is a
    macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed
    in order to access an actual object, or a program defines an identifier with the name
    errno, the behavior is undefined.
3   The value of errno is zero at program startup, but is never set to zero by any library
    function.<sup><a href="#note176"><b>176)</b></a></sup> The value of errno may be set to nonzero by a library function call
    whether or not there is an error, provided the use of errno is not documented in the
    description of the function in this International Standard.
4   Additional macro definitions, beginning with E and a digit or E and an uppercase
    letter,<sup><a href="#note177"><b>177)</b></a></sup> may also be specified by the implementation.




    <sup><a name="note175" href="#note175"><b>175)</b></a></sup> The macro errno need not be the identifier of an object. It might expand to a modifiable lvalue
         resulting from a function call (for example, *errno()).
    <sup><a name="note176" href="#note176"><b>176)</b></a></sup> Thus, a program that uses errno for error checking should set it to zero before a library function call,
         then inspect it before a subsequent library function call. Of course, a library function can save the
         value of errno on entry and then set it to zero, as long as the original value is restored if errno's
         value is still zero just before the return.

<a name="7.6" href="#7.6"><b>    7.6 Floating-point environment &lt;fenv.h&gt;</b></a>
1   The header <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> declares two types and several macros and functions to provide
    access to the floating-point environment. The floating-point environment refers
    collectively to any floating-point status flags and control modes supported by the
    implementation.<sup><a href="#note178"><b>178)</b></a></sup> A floating-point status flag is a system variable whose value is set
    (but never cleared) when a floating-point exception is raised, which occurs as a side effect
    of exceptional floating-point arithmetic to provide auxiliary information.<sup><a href="#note179"><b>179)</b></a></sup> A floating-
    point control mode is a system variable whose value may be set by the user to affect the
    subsequent behavior of floating-point arithmetic.
2   Certain programming conventions support the intended model of use for the floating-
    point environment:<sup><a href="#note180"><b>180)</b></a></sup>
    -- a function call does not alter its caller's floating-point control modes, clear its caller's
      floating-point status flags, nor depend on the state of its caller's floating-point status
      flags unless the function is so documented;
    -- a function call is assumed to require default floating-point control modes, unless its
      documentation promises otherwise;
    -- a function call is assumed to have the potential for raising floating-point exceptions,
      unless its documentation promises otherwise.
3   The type
            fenv_t
    represents the entire floating-point environment.
4   The type
            fexcept_t
    represents the floating-point status flags collectively, including any status the
    implementation associates with the flags.




    <sup><a name="note178" href="#note178"><b>178)</b></a></sup> This header is designed to support the floating-point exception status flags and directed-rounding
         control modes required by IEC 60559, and other similar floating-point state information. Also it is
         designed to facilitate code portability among all systems.
    <sup><a name="note179" href="#note179"><b>179)</b></a></sup> A floating-point status flag is not an object and can be set more than once within an expression.
    <sup><a name="note180" href="#note180"><b>180)</b></a></sup> With these conventions, a programmer can safely assume default floating-point control modes (or be
         unaware of them). The responsibilities associated with accessing the floating-point environment fall
         on the programmer or program that does so explicitly.

5   Each of the macros

            FE_INVALID
            FE_OVERFLOW
            FE_UNDERFLOW
    is defined if and only if the implementation supports the floating-point exception by
    means of the functions in 7.6.2.<sup><a href="#note181"><b>181)</b></a></sup> Additional implementation-defined floating-point
    exceptions, with macro definitions beginning with FE_ and an uppercase letter, may also
    be specified by the implementation. The defined macros expand to integer constant
    expressions with values such that bitwise ORs of all combinations of the macros result in
    distinct values, and furthermore, bitwise ANDs of all combinations of the macros result in
    zero.<sup><a href="#note182"><b>182)</b></a></sup>
6   The macro
            FE_ALL_EXCEPT
    is simply the bitwise OR of all floating-point exception macros defined by the
    implementation. If no such macros are defined, FE_ALL_EXCEPT shall be defined as 0.
7   Each of the macros
            FE_DOWNWARD
            FE_TONEAREST
            FE_TOWARDZERO
            FE_UPWARD
    is defined if and only if the implementation supports getting and setting the represented
    rounding direction by means of the fegetround and fesetround functions.
    Additional implementation-defined rounding directions, with macro definitions beginning
    with FE_ and an uppercase letter, may also be specified by the implementation. The
    defined macros expand to integer constant expressions whose values are distinct
    nonnegative values.<sup><a href="#note183"><b>183)</b></a></sup>
8   The macro



    <sup><a name="note181" href="#note181"><b>181)</b></a></sup> The implementation supports an exception if there are circumstances where a call to at least one of the
         functions in <a href="#7.6.2">7.6.2</a>, using the macro as the appropriate argument, will succeed. It is not necessary for
         all the functions to succeed all the time.
    <sup><a name="note182" href="#note182"><b>182)</b></a></sup> The macros should be distinct powers of two.
    <sup><a name="note183" href="#note183"><b>183)</b></a></sup> Even though the rounding direction macros may expand to constants corresponding to the values of
         FLT_ROUNDS, they are not required to do so.

             FE_DFL_ENV
    represents the default floating-point environment -- the one installed at program startup
    -- and has type ''pointer to const-qualified fenv_t''. It can be used as an argument to
    <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> functions that manage the floating-point environment.
9   Additional implementation-defined environments, with macro definitions beginning with
    FE_ and an uppercase letter, and having type ''pointer to const-qualified fenv_t'', may

<a name="7.6.1" href="#7.6.1"><b>    7.6.1 The FENV_ACCESS pragma</b></a>
<b>    Synopsis</b>
1            #include <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a>
             #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS on-off-switch
<b>    Description</b>
2   The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implementation when a
    program might access the floating-point environment to test floating-point status flags or
    run under non-default floating-point control modes.<sup><a href="#note184"><b>184)</b></a></sup> The pragma shall occur either
    outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements inside a
    compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes effect from
    its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or until the end of
    the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes effect from its
    occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within a
    nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at the end of a
    compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the
    compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is
    undefined. If part of a program tests floating-point status flags, sets floating-point control
    modes, or runs under non-default mode settings, but was translated with the state for the
    FENV_ACCESS pragma ''off'', the behavior is undefined. The default state (''on'' or
    ''off'') for the pragma is implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part of
    the program translated with FENV_ACCESS ''off'' to a part translated with
    FENV_ACCESS ''on'', the state of the floating-point status flags is unspecified and the
    floating-point control modes have their default settings.)




    <sup><a name="note184" href="#note184"><b>184)</b></a></sup> The purpose of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is to allow certain optimizations that could subvert flag
         tests and mode changes (e.g., global common subexpression elimination, code motion, and constant
         folding). In general, if the state of FENV_ACCESS is ''off'', the translator can assume that default
         modes are in effect and the flags are not tested.

4   If the function g might depend on status flags set as a side effect of the first x + 1, or if the second

    input argument for the functions represents a subset of floating-point exceptions, and can
    be zero or the bitwise OR of one or more floating-point exception macros, for example
    FE_OVERFLOW | FE_INEXACT. For other argument values the behavior of these

    <sup><a name="note185" href="#note185"><b>185)</b></a></sup> The side effects impose a temporal ordering that requires two evaluations of x + 1. On the other

         ''off'', just one evaluation of x + 1 would suffice.
    <sup><a name="note186" href="#note186"><b>186)</b></a></sup> The functions fetestexcept, feraiseexcept, and feclearexcept support the basic
         abstraction of flags that are either set or clear. An implementation may endow floating-point status
         flags with more information -- for example, the address of the code which first raised the floating-
         point exception; the functions fegetexceptflag and fesetexceptflag deal with the full

<b>    Returns</b>
6   If a pointer to a string is given for locale and the selection can be honored, the
    setlocale function returns a pointer to the string associated with the specified
    category for the new locale. If the selection cannot be honored, the setlocale
    function returns a null pointer and the program's locale is not changed.
7   A null pointer for locale causes the setlocale function to return a pointer to the
    string associated with the category for the program's current locale; the program's
    locale is not changed.<sup><a href="#note197"><b>197)</b></a></sup>

    overwritten by a subsequent call to the setlocale function.

<b>    Description</b>
2   The localeconv function sets the components of an object with type struct lconv
    with values appropriate for the formatting of numeric quantities (monetary and otherwise)
    according to the rules of the current locale.
3   The members of the structure with type char * are pointers to strings, any of which
    (except decimal_point) can point to "", to indicate that the value is not available in
    the current locale or is of zero length. Apart from grouping and mon_grouping, the

          negative locally formatted monetary quantity.
char *int_curr_symbol
          The international currency symbol applicable to the current locale. The
          first three characters contain the alphabetic international currency symbol
          in accordance with those specified in ISO 4217. The fourth character
          (immediately preceding the null character) is the character used to separate
          the international currency symbol from the monetary quantity.
char int_frac_digits
          The number of fractional digits (those after the decimal-point) to be
          displayed in an internationally formatted monetary quantity.
char int_p_cs_precedes

              Set to a value indicating the positioning of the negative_sign for a
              negative internationally formatted monetary quantity.
4   The elements of grouping and mon_grouping are interpreted according to the
    following:
    CHAR_MAX      No further grouping is to be performed.
    0             The previous element is to be repeatedly used for the remainder of the
                  digits.
    other         The integer value is the number of digits that compose the current group.
                  The next element is examined to determine the size of the next group of
                  digits before the current group.
5   The values of p_sep_by_space, n_sep_by_space, int_p_sep_by_space,
    and int_n_sep_by_space are interpreted according to the following:
    0   No space separates the currency symbol and value.
    1   If the currency symbol and sign string are adjacent, a space separates them from the
        value; otherwise, a space separates the currency symbol from the value.
    2   If the currency symbol and sign string are adjacent, a space separates them;
        otherwise, a space separates the sign string from the value.
    For int_p_sep_by_space and int_n_sep_by_space, the fourth character of
    int_curr_symbol is used instead of a space.
6   The values of p_sign_posn, n_sign_posn, int_p_sign_posn,                            and
    int_n_sign_posn are interpreted according to the following:
    0   Parentheses surround the quantity and currency symbol.
    1   The sign string precedes the quantity and currency symbol.
    2   The sign string succeeds the quantity and currency symbol.
    3   The sign string immediately precedes the currency symbol.
    4   The sign string immediately succeeds the currency symbol.

5   The macro
             NAN
    is defined if and only if the implementation supports quiet NaNs for the float type. It
    expands to a constant expression of type float representing a quiet NaN.

    constant expressions with distinct values. Additional implementation-defined floating-
    point classifications, with macro definitions beginning with FP_ and an uppercase letter,
    may also be specified by the implementation.
7   The macro
             FP_FAST_FMA
    is optionally defined. If defined, it indicates that the fma function generally executes
    about as fast as, or faster than, a multiply and an add of double operands.<sup><a href="#note202"><b>202)</b></a></sup> The
    macros
             FP_FAST_FMAF

             FP_ILOGBNAN
    expand to integer constant expressions whose values are returned by ilogb(x) if x is

9   The macros

    expand to the integer constants 1 and 2, respectively; the macro
            math_errhandling
    expands to an expression that has type int and the value MATH_ERRNO,
    MATH_ERREXCEPT, or the bitwise OR of both. The value of math_errhandling is
    constant for the duration of the program. It is unspecified whether
    math_errhandling is a macro or an identifier with external linkage. If a macro
    definition is suppressed or a program defines an identifier with the name
    math_errhandling, the behavior is undefined.               If the expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT can be nonzero, the implementation
    shall define the macros FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW in

1   The behavior of each of the functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> is specified for all representable

    as if it were a single operation without generating any externally visible exceptional
    conditions.
2   For all functions, a domain error occurs if an input argument is outside the domain over
    which the mathematical function is defined. The description of each function lists any
    required domain errors; an implementation may define additional domain errors, provided
    that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.<sup><a href="#note203"><b>203)</b></a></sup> On a
    domain error, the function returns an implementation-defined value; if the integer
    expression math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, the integer expression
    errno acquires the value EDOM; if the integer expression math_errhandling &amp;
    MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the ''invalid'' floating-point exception is raised.
3   Similarly, a range error occurs if the mathematical result of the function cannot be
    represented in an object of the specified type, due to extreme magnitude.
4   A floating result overflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is finite but so
    large that the mathematical result cannot be represented without extraordinary roundoff
    error in an object of the specified type. If a floating result overflows and default rounding
    is in effect, or if the mathematical result is an exact infinity from finite arguments (for
    example log(0.0)), then the function returns the value of the macro HUGE_VAL,


    <sup><a name="note203" href="#note203"><b>203)</b></a></sup> In an implementation that supports infinities, this allows an infinity as an argument to be a domain
         error if the mathematical domain of the function does not include the infinity.

[<a name="p214" href="#p214">page 214</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL according to the return type, with the same sign as the
    correct value of the function; if the integer expression math_errhandling &amp;
    MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, the integer expression errno acquires the value ERANGE; if
    the integer expression math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the
    ''divide-by-zero'' floating-point exception is raised if the mathematical result is an exact
    infinity and the ''overflow'' floating-point exception is raised otherwise.
5   The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is so small that the
    mathematical result cannot be represented, without extraordinary roundoff error, in an
    object of the specified type.<sup><a href="#note204"><b>204)</b></a></sup> If the result underflows, the function returns an
    implementation-defined value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest
    normalized positive number in the specified type; if the integer expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, whether errno acquires the
    value    ERANGE       is    implementation-defined;     if   the  integer   expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, whether the ''underflow''
    floating-point exception is raised is implementation-defined.

    effect from its occurrence until another FP_CONTRACT pragma is encountered
    (including within a nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound
    statement; at the end of a compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its

4   After longjmp is completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding
    invocation of the setjmp macro had just returned the value specified by val. The
    longjmp function cannot cause the setjmp macro to return the value 0; if val is 0,
    the setjmp macro returns the value 1.
5   EXAMPLE The longjmp function that returns control back to the point of the setjmp invocation
    might cause memory associated with a variable length array object to be squandered.

1   The header <a href="#7.14">&lt;signal.h&gt;</a> declares a type and two functions and defines several macros,
    for handling various signals (conditions that may be reported during program execution).
2   The type defined is
            sig_atomic_t
    which is the (possibly volatile-qualified) integer type of an object that can be accessed as
    an atomic entity, even in the presence of asynchronous interrupts.
3   The macros defined are
            SIG_DFL
            SIG_ERR
            SIG_IGN
    which expand to constant expressions with distinct values that have type compatible with
    the second argument to, and the return value of, the signal function, and whose values
    compare unequal to the address of any declarable function; and the following, which
    expand to positive integer constant expressions with type int and distinct values that are
    the signal numbers, each corresponding to the specified condition:
            SIGABRT abnormal termination, such as is initiated by the abort function
            SIGFPE         an erroneous arithmetic operation, such as zero divide or an operation
                           resulting in overflow
            SIGILL         detection of an invalid function image, such as an invalid instruction
            SIGINT         receipt of an interactive attention signal
            SIGSEGV an invalid access to storage
            SIGTERM a termination request sent to the program
4   An implementation need not generate any of these signals, except as a result of explicit
    calls to the raise function. Additional signals and pointers to undeclarable functions,
    with macro definitions beginning, respectively, with the letters SIG and an uppercase
    letter or with SIG_ and an uppercase letter,<sup><a href="#note219"><b>219)</b></a></sup> may also be specified by the
    implementation. The complete set of signals, their semantics, and their default handling
    is implementation-defined; all signal numbers shall be positive.




    <sup><a name="note219" href="#note219"><b>219)</b></a></sup> See ''future library directions'' (<a href="#7.26.9">7.26.9</a>). The names of the signal numbers reflect the following terms

         and termination.

<a name="7.14.1.1" href="#7.14.1.1"><b>    7.14.1.1 The signal function</b></a>
<b>    Synopsis</b>
1           #include <a href="#7.14">&lt;signal.h&gt;</a>
            void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
<b>    Description</b>
2   The signal function chooses one of three ways in which receipt of the signal number
    sig is to be subsequently handled. If the value of func is SIG_DFL, default handling
    for that signal will occur. If the value of func is SIG_IGN, the signal will be ignored.
    Otherwise, func shall point to a function to be called when that signal occurs. An
    invocation of such a function because of a signal, or (recursively) of any further functions
    called by that invocation (other than functions in the standard library), is called a signal
    handler.
3   When a signal occurs and func points to a function, it is implementation-defined
    whether the equivalent of signal(sig, SIG_DFL); is executed or the
    implementation prevents some implementation-defined set of signals (at least including
    sig) from occurring until the current signal handling has completed; in the case of
    SIGILL, the implementation may alternatively define that no action is taken. Then the
    equivalent of (*func)(sig); is executed. If and when the function returns, if the
    value of sig is SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or any other implementation-defined
    value corresponding to a computational exception, the behavior is undefined; otherwise
    the program will resume execution at the point it was interrupted.
4   If the signal occurs as the result of calling the abort or raise function, the signal
    handler shall not call the raise function.
5   If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the abort or raise function, the
    behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any object with static storage duration
    other than by assigning a value to an object declared as volatile sig_atomic_t, or
    the signal handler calls any function in the standard library other than the abort
    function, the _Exit function, or the signal function with the first argument equal to
    the signal number corresponding to the signal that caused the invocation of the handler.
    Furthermore, if such a call to the signal function results in a SIG_ERR return, the
    value of errno is indeterminate.<sup><a href="#note220"><b>220)</b></a></sup>

    may be executed for some signals selected in an implementation-defined manner; the
    equivalent of
           signal(sig, SIG_DFL);
    is executed for all other signals defined by the implementation.
7   The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the signal function.
<b>    Returns</b>
8   If the request can be honored, the signal function returns the value of func for the
    most recent successful call to signal for the specified signal sig. Otherwise, a value of
    SIG_ERR is returned and a positive value is stored in errno.

2   A function may be called with a variable number of arguments of varying types. As

2   The types are

1   The typedef name intN_t designates a signed integer type with width N , no padding
    bits, and a two's complement representation. Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer
    type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
2   The typedef name uintN_t designates an unsigned integer type with width N . Thus,
    uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits.
3   These types are optional. However, if an implementation provides integer types with
    widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, no padding bits, and (for the signed types) that have a
    two's complement representation, it shall define the corresponding typedef names.

4   The header <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a> declares a number of functions useful for wide character input
    and output. The wide character input/output functions described in that subclause
    provide operations analogous to most of those described here, except that the
    fundamental units internal to the program are wide characters. The external
    representation (in the file) is a sequence of ''generalized'' multibyte characters, as
    described further in <a href="#7.19.3">7.19.3</a>.
5   The input/output functions are given the following collective terms:
    -- The wide character input functions -- those functions described in <a href="#7.24">7.24</a> that perform
      input into wide characters and wide strings: fgetwc, fgetws, getwc, getwchar,

      output from wide characters and wide strings: fputwc, fputws, putwc,
      putwchar, fwprintf, wprintf, vfwprintf, and vwprintf.

<a name="7.19.2" href="#7.19.2"><b>    7.19.2 Streams</b></a>
1   Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as terminals and tape drives,
    or whether to or from files supported on structured storage devices, are mapped into
    logical data streams, whose properties are more uniform than their various inputs and
    outputs. Two forms of mapping are supported, for text streams and for binary
    streams.<sup><a href="#note232"><b>232)</b></a></sup>
2   A text stream is an ordered sequence of characters composed into lines, each line
    consisting of zero or more characters plus a terminating new-line character. Whether the
    last line requires a terminating new-line character is implementation-defined. Characters
    may have to be added, altered, or deleted on input and output to conform to differing
    conventions for representing text in the host environment. Thus, there need not be a one-
    to-one correspondence between the characters in a stream and those in the external
    representation. Data read in from a text stream will necessarily compare equal to the data
    that were earlier written out to that stream only if: the data consist only of printing
    characters and the control characters horizontal tab and new-line; no new-line character is
    immediately preceded by space characters; and the last character is a new-line character.
    Whether space characters that are written out immediately before a new-line character
    appear when read in is implementation-defined.
3   A binary stream is an ordered sequence of characters that can transparently record
    internal data. Data read in from a binary stream shall compare equal to the data that were
    earlier written out to that stream, under the same implementation. Such a stream may,
    however, have an implementation-defined number of null characters appended to the end
    of the stream.
4   Each stream has an orientation. After a stream is associated with an external file, but
    before any operations are performed on it, the stream is without orientation. Once a wide
    character input/output function has been applied to a stream without orientation, the


    <sup><a name="note232" href="#note232"><b>232)</b></a></sup> An implementation need not distinguish between text streams and binary streams. In such an

    stream becomes a wide-oriented stream. Similarly, once a byte input/output function has
    been applied to a stream without orientation, the stream becomes a byte-oriented stream.
    Only a call to the freopen function or the fwide function can otherwise alter the
    orientation of a stream. (A successful call to freopen removes any orientation.)<sup><a href="#note233"><b>233)</b></a></sup>
5   Byte input/output functions shall not be applied to a wide-oriented stream and wide
    character input/output functions shall not be applied to a byte-oriented stream. The
    remaining stream operations do not affect, and are not affected by, a stream's orientation,
    except for the following additional restrictions:
    -- Binary wide-oriented streams have the file-positioning restrictions ascribed to both
      text and binary streams.
    -- For wide-oriented streams, after a successful call to a file-positioning function that
      leaves the file position indicator prior to the end-of-file, a wide character output
      function can overwrite a partial multibyte character; any file contents beyond the
      byte(s) written are henceforth indeterminate.
6   Each wide-oriented stream has an associated mbstate_t object that stores the current
    parse state of the stream. A successful call to fgetpos stores a representation of the
    value of this mbstate_t object as part of the value of the fpos_t object. A later
    successful call to fsetpos using the same stored fpos_t value restores the value of
    the associated mbstate_t object as well as the position within the controlled stream.

<a name="7.19.3" href="#7.19.3"><b>    7.19.3 Files</b></a>
1   A stream is associated with an external file (which may be a physical device) by opening
    a file, which may involve creating a new file. Creating an existing file causes its former
    contents to be discarded, if necessary. If a file can support positioning requests (such as a
    disk file, as opposed to a terminal), then a file position indicator associated with the
    stream is positioned at the start (character number zero) of the file, unless the file is
    opened with append mode in which case it is implementation-defined whether the file
    position indicator is initially positioned at the beginning or the end of the file. The file
    position indicator is maintained by subsequent reads, writes, and positioning requests, to
    facilitate an orderly progression through the file.
2   Binary files are not truncated, except as defined in <a href="#7.19.5.3">7.19.5.3</a>. Whether a write on a text
    stream causes the associated file to be truncated beyond that point is implementation-
    defined.
3   When a stream is unbuffered, characters are intended to appear from the source or at the
    destination as soon as possible. Otherwise characters may be accumulated and
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block. When a stream is fully buffered,
    characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when
    a buffer is filled. When a stream is line buffered, characters are intended to be
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a new-line character is
    encountered. Furthermore, characters are intended to be transmitted as a block to the host
    environment when a buffer is filled, when input is requested on an unbuffered stream, or
    when input is requested on a line buffered stream that requires the transmission of
    characters from the host environment. Support for these characteristics is
    implementation-defined, and may be affected via the setbuf and setvbuf functions.
4   A file may be disassociated from a controlling stream by closing the file. Output streams
    are flushed (any unwritten buffer contents are transmitted to the host environment) before
    the stream is disassociated from the file. The value of a pointer to a FILE object is
    indeterminate after the associated file is closed (including the standard text streams).
    Whether a file of zero length (on which no characters have been written by an output
    stream) actually exists is implementation-defined.
5   The file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or another program execution, and
    its contents reclaimed or modified (if it can be repositioned at its start). If the main
    function returns to its original caller, or if the exit function is called, all open files are
    closed (hence all output streams are flushed) before program termination. Other paths to
    program termination, such as calling the abort function, need not close all files
    properly.
6   The address of the FILE object used to control a stream may be significant; a copy of a
    FILE object need not serve in place of the original.

[<a name="p266" href="#p266">page 266</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

7    At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not be opened explicitly
     -- standard input (for reading conventional input), standard output (for writing
     conventional output), and standard error (for writing diagnostic output). As initially
     opened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered; the standard input and standard
     output streams are fully buffered if and only if the stream can be determined not to refer
     to an interactive device.
8    Functions that open additional (nontemporary) files require a file name, which is a string.
     The rules for composing valid file names are implementation-defined. Whether the same
     file can be simultaneously open multiple times is also implementation-defined.
9    Although both text and binary wide-oriented streams are conceptually sequences of wide
     characters, the external file associated with a wide-oriented stream is a sequence of
     multibyte characters, generalized as follows:
     -- Multibyte encodings within files may contain embedded null bytes (unlike multibyte
       encodings valid for use internal to the program).
     -- A file need not begin nor end in the initial shift state.<sup><a href="#note234"><b>234)</b></a></sup>
10   Moreover, the encodings used for multibyte characters may differ among files. Both the
     nature and choice of such encodings are implementation-defined.
11   The wide character input functions read multibyte characters from the stream and convert
     them to wide characters as if they were read by successive calls to the fgetwc function.
     Each conversion occurs as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with the conversion state
     described by the stream's own mbstate_t object. The byte input functions read
     characters from the stream as if by successive calls to the fgetc function.
12   The wide character output functions convert wide characters to multibyte characters and
     write them to the stream as if they were written by successive calls to the fputwc
     function. Each conversion occurs as if by a call to the wcrtomb function, with the
     conversion state described by the stream's own mbstate_t object. The byte output
     functions write characters to the stream as if by successive calls to the fputc function.
13   In some cases, some of the byte input/output functions also perform conversions between
     multibyte characters and wide characters. These conversions also occur as if by calls to
     the mbrtowc and wcrtomb functions.
14   An encoding error occurs if the character sequence presented to the underlying
     mbrtowc function does not form a valid (generalized) multibyte character, or if the code
     value passed to the underlying wcrtomb does not correspond to a valid (generalized)


     <sup><a name="note234" href="#note234"><b>234)</b></a></sup> Setting the file position indicator to end-of-file, as with fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END), has
          undefined behavior for a binary stream (because of possible trailing null characters) or for any stream

            int fprintf(FILE * restrict stream,
                 const char * restrict format, ...);
<b>    Description</b>
2   The fprintf function writes output to the stream pointed to by stream, under control
    of the string pointed to by format that specifies how subsequent arguments are
    converted for output. If there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behavior is
    undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are
    evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored. The fprintf function returns when
    the end of the format string is encountered.
3   The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial
    shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary multibyte
    characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion


    <sup><a name="note239" href="#note239"><b>239)</b></a></sup> The buffer has to have a lifetime at least as great as the open stream, so the stream should be closed

    specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments,
    converting them, if applicable, according to the corresponding conversion specifier, and
    then writing the result to the output stream.
4   Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %. After the %, the following
    appear in sequence:
    -- Zero or more flags (in any order) that modify the meaning of the conversion
      specification.
    -- An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer characters than the
      field width, it is padded with spaces (by default) on the left (or right, if the left
      adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the field width. The field width
      takes the form of an asterisk * (described later) or a nonnegative decimal integer.<sup><a href="#note241"><b>241)</b></a></sup>
    -- An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the d, i,
      o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point
      character for a, A, e, E, f, and F conversions, the maximum number of significant
      digits for the g and G conversions, or the maximum number of bytes to be written for
      s conversions. The precision takes the form of a period (.) followed either by an
      asterisk * (described later) or by an optional decimal integer; if only the period is
      specified, the precision is taken as zero. If a precision appears with any other
      conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.
    -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the argument.
    -- A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
5   As noted above, a field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an asterisk. In
    this case, an int argument supplies the field width or precision. The arguments
    specifying field width, or precision, or both, shall appear (in that order) before the
    argument (if any) to be converted. A negative field width argument is taken as a - flag
    followed by a positive field width. A negative precision argument is taken as if the
    precision were omitted.
6   The flag characters and their meanings are:
    -        The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
             this flag is not specified.)
    +        The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
             begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not




    <sup><a name="note241" href="#note241"><b>241)</b></a></sup> Note that 0 is taken as a flag, not as the beginning of a field width.

              specified.)<sup><a href="#note242"><b>242)</b></a></sup>
    space If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion
          results in no characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the space and + flags
          both appear, the space flag is ignored.
    #         The result is converted to an ''alternative form''. For o conversion, it increases
              the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
              zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x (or X)
              conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g,
              and G conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
              contains a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a
              decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit
              follows it.) For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
              result. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
    0         For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, leading zeros
              (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather
              than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the
              0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X
              conversions, if a precision is specified, the 0 flag is ignored. For other
              conversions, the behavior is undefined.

    the behavior is undefined.
8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i         The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [-]dddd. The
                precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
                being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
                leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
                value with a precision of zero is no characters.
    o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
            decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd; the
            letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
            conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
            if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
            with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
            zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.

[<a name="p277" href="#p277">page 277</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

f,F          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
             decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
             the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification. If the
             precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
             not specified, no decimal-point character appears. If a decimal-point
             character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is rounded to
             the appropriate number of digits.
             A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
             [-]inf or [-]infinity -- which style is implementation-defined. A
             double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
             [-]nan or [-]nan(n-char-sequence) -- which style, and the meaning of
             any n-char-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier
             produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or nan,
             respectively.<sup><a href="#note243"><b>243)</b></a></sup>
e,E          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
             style [-]d.ddd e(+-)dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
             argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point character and the number of
             digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as
             6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
             character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
             The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
             introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
             and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
             value is zero, the exponent is zero.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
g,G          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
             style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
             depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
             precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
             Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X :
             -- if P &gt; X &gt;= -4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
               P - (X + 1).

              fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
              there is no fractional portion remaining.
              A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
              of an f or F conversion specifier.
a,A           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
              style [-]0xh.hhhh p(+-)d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
              nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
              otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character<sup><a href="#note244"><b>244)</b></a></sup> and the number
              of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is
              missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient for
              an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
              FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
              distinguish<sup><a href="#note245"><b>245)</b></a></sup> values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
              omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
              point character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion and
              the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier produces a
              number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always contains at
              least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the
              decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.
              A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
              of an f or F conversion specifier.
c             If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an
              unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
              If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted as if by
              an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points
              to the initial element of a two-element array of wchar_t, the first element
              containing the wint_t argument to the lc conversion specification and the
              second a null wide character.
s             If no l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
              element of an array of character type.<sup><a href="#note246"><b>246)</b></a></sup> Characters from the array are

11   For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the value is correctly rounded
     to a hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.
     Recommended practice
12   For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2 and the result is not exactly
     representable in the given precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent numbers
     in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra stipulation that the
     error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.
13   For e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, if the number of significant decimal digits is at most
     DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be correctly rounded.<sup><a href="#note249"><b>249)</b></a></sup> If the number of
     significant decimal digits is more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly
     representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be an exact
     representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two
     adjacent decimal strings L &lt; U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the value
     of the resultant decimal string D should satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U, with the extra stipulation that
     the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.
<b>     Returns</b>
14   The fprintf function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value
     if an output or encoding error occurred.
     Environmental limits
15   The number of characters that can be produced by any single conversion shall be at least
     4095.
16   EXAMPLE 1 To print a date and time in the form ''Sunday, July 3, 10:02'' followed by pi to five decimal
     places:

<b>     Synopsis</b>
1             #include <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>
              int fscanf(FILE * restrict stream,
                   const char * restrict format, ...);
<b>     Description</b>
2    The fscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under control
     of the string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input sequences and how
     they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments as pointers to the
     objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient arguments for the format,
     the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
     arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored.
3    The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial
     shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space
     characters, an ordinary multibyte character (neither % nor a white-space character), or a
     conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
     After the %, the following appear in sequence:
     -- An optional assignment-suppressing character *.
     -- An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
       (in characters).

[<a name="p282" href="#p282">page 282</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

     -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
     -- A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
4    The fscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as
     detailed below, the function returns. Failures are described as input failures (due to the
     occurrence of an encoding error or the unavailability of input characters), or matching
     failures (due to inappropriate input).
5    A directive composed of white-space character(s) is executed by reading input up to the
     first non-white-space character (which remains unread), or until no more characters can
     be read.
6    A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed by reading the next
     characters of the stream. If any of those characters differ from the ones composing the
     directive, the directive fails and the differing and subsequent characters remain unread.
     Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a character from being
     read, the directive fails.
7    A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as
     described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the
     following steps:
8    Input white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function) are skipped, unless
     the specification includes a [, c, or n specifier.<sup><a href="#note250"><b>250)</b></a></sup>
9    An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an n specifier. An
     input item is defined as the longest sequence of input characters which does not exceed
     any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching input sequence.<sup><a href="#note251"><b>251)</b></a></sup>
     The first character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input
     item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure unless
     end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which
     case it is an input failure.
10   Except in the case of a % specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a %n directive, the
     count of input characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion specifier. If
     the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails: this
     condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a *, the
     result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following
     the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this object
     does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented


     <sup><a name="note250" href="#note250"><b>250)</b></a></sup> These white-space characters are not counted against a specified field width.
     <sup><a name="note251" href="#note251"><b>251)</b></a></sup> fscanf pushes back at most one input character onto the input stream. Therefore, some sequences
          that are acceptable to strtod, strtol, etc., are unacceptable to fscanf.

                  conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to wchar_t.
     ll (ell-ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                  to an argument with type pointer to long long int or unsigned
                  long long int.
     j            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                  to an argument with type pointer to intmax_t or uintmax_t.
     z            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies

                  integer type.
     t            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                  to an argument with type pointer to ptrdiff_t or the corresponding
                  unsigned integer type.
     L            Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier
                  applies to an argument with type pointer to long double.
     If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above,
     the behavior is undefined.
12   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
     d           Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as
                 expected for the subject sequence of the strtol function with the value 10
                 for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                 signed integer.
     i           Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as expected
                 for the subject sequence of the strtol function with the value 0 for the
                 base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to signed

o             Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as
              expected for the subject sequence of the strtoul function with the value 8
              for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to

x             Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same
              as expected for the subject sequence of the strtoul function with the value
              16 for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
              unsigned integer.
a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose
        format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the strtod
        function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to floating.
c             Matches a sequence of characters of exactly the number specified by the field
              width (1 if no field width is present in the directive).<sup><a href="#note252"><b>252)</b></a></sup>
              If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
              pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
              sequence. No null character is added.
              If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
              characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character in the
              sequence is converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc
              function, with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
              initialized to zero before the first multibyte character is converted. The
              corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
              wchar_t large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide characters.
              No null wide character is added.
s             Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters.252)
              If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
              pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
              sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
              If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte


<sup><a name="note252" href="#note252"><b>252)</b></a></sup> No special provisions are made for multibyte characters in the matching rules used by the c, s, and [

         characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is

         the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
         before the first multibyte character is converted. The corresponding argument
         shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough
         to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be
         added automatically.
[        Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from a set of expected characters
         (the scanset).252)
         If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
         pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
         sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
         If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
         characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is
         converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with
         the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
         before the first multibyte character is converted. The corresponding argument
         shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough
         to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be
         added automatically.
         The conversion specifier includes all subsequent characters in the format
         string, up to and including the matching right bracket (]). The characters
         between the brackets (the scanlist) compose the scanset, unless the character
         after the left bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the scanset contains all
         characters that do not appear in the scanlist between the circumflex and the
         right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with [] or [^], the right
         bracket character is in the scanlist and the next following right bracket
         character is the matching right bracket that ends the specification; otherwise
         the first following right bracket character is the one that ends the
         specification. If a - character is in the scanlist and is not the first, nor the
         second where the first character is a ^, nor the last character, the behavior is
         implementation-defined.
p        Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
         same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
         the fprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
         pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
         implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
         during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
         equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.

[<a name="p286" href="#p286">page 286</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

     n              No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                    signed integer into which is to be written the number of characters read from
                    the input stream so far by this call to the fscanf function. Execution of a
                    %n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
                    completion of execution of the fscanf function. No argument is converted,
                    but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignment-
                    suppressing character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.
     %              Matches a single % character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
                    complete conversion specification shall be %%.
13   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.<sup><a href="#note253"><b>253)</b></a></sup>
14   The conversion specifiers A, E, F, G, and X are also valid and behave the same as,
     respectively, a, e, f, g, and x.
15   Trailing white space (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a
     directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is not directly
     determinable other than via the %n directive.
<b>     Returns</b>
16   The fscanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
     before any conversion. Otherwise, the function returns the number of input items
     assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early
     matching failure.

     with the input line:

     sequence 56\0. The next character read from the input stream will be a.

19   EXAMPLE 3         To accept repeatedly from stdin a quantity, a unit of measure, and an item name:
              #include <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>

              int count; float quant; char units[21], item[21];

     the value 123 is assigned to d1 and the value 3 to n1. Because %n can never get an input failure the value
     of 3 is also assigned to n2. The value of d2 is not affected. The value 1 is assigned to i.

22   EXAMPLE 5 In these examples, multibyte characters do have a state-dependent encoding, and the
     members of the extended character set that consist of more than one byte each consist of exactly two bytes,
     the first of which is denoted here by a and the second by an uppercase letter, but are only recognized as
     such when in the alternate shift state. The shift sequences are denoted by (uparrow) and (downarrow), in which the first causes
     entry into the alternate shift state.
23   After the call:

     with the input line:
               a(uparrow) X Y(downarrow) bc
     str will contain (uparrow) X Y(downarrow)\0 assuming that none of the bytes of the shift sequences (or of the multibyte
     characters, in the more general case) appears to be a single-byte white-space character.
24   In contrast, after the call:
               #include <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>
               #include <a href="#7.17">&lt;stddef.h&gt;</a>

               wchar_t wstr[50];
               fscanf(stdin, "a%ls", wstr);
     with the same input line, wstr will contain the two wide characters that correspond to X and Y and a
     terminating null wide character.
25   However, the call:

<b>    Description</b>
2   The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is written into

<b>    Description</b>
2   The ungetc function pushes the character specified by c (converted to an unsigned

3   One character of pushback is guaranteed. If the ungetc function is called too many
    times on the same stream without an intervening read or file positioning operation on that

<b>    Description</b>
2   The fread function reads, into the array pointed to by ptr, up to nmemb elements

<b>    Description</b>
2   The strtod, strtof, and strtold functions convert the initial portion of the string
    pointed to by nptr to double, float, and long double representation,
    respectively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial, possibly
    empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function), a
    subject sequence resembling a floating-point constant or representing an infinity or NaN;
    and a final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the terminating null
    character of the input string. Then, they attempt to convert the subject sequence to a
    floating-point number, and return the result.
3   The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional plus or minus sign, then one of
    the following:
    -- a nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point
      character, then an optional exponent part as defined in <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>;
    -- a 0x or 0X, then a nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a
      decimal-point character, then an optional binary exponent part as defined in <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>;
    -- INF or INFINITY, ignoring case
    -- NAN or NAN(n-char-sequenceopt), ignoring case in the NAN part, where:
               n-char-sequence:
                      digit
                      nondigit
                      n-char-sequence digit
                      n-char-sequence nondigit
    The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input string,
    starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of the expected form. The subject
    sequence contains no characters if the input string is not of the expected form.
4   If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point number, the sequence of
    characters starting with the first digit or the decimal-point character (whichever occurs
    first) is interpreted as a floating constant according to the rules of <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>, except that the

[<a name="p308" href="#p308">page 308</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    decimal-point character is used in place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part
    nor a decimal-point character appears in a decimal floating point number, or if a binary
    exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal floating point number, an exponent part
    of the appropriate type with value zero is assumed to follow the last digit in the string. If
    the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the sequence is interpreted as negated.<sup><a href="#note258"><b>258)</b></a></sup>
    A character sequence INF or INFINITY is interpreted as an infinity, if representable in
    the return type, else like a floating constant that is too large for the range of the return
    type. A character sequence NAN or NAN(n-char-sequenceopt), is interpreted as a quiet
    NaN, if supported in the return type, else like a subject sequence part that does not have
    the expected form; the meaning of the n-char sequences is implementation-defined.<sup><a href="#note259"><b>259)</b></a></sup> A
    pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that
    endptr is not a null pointer.
5   If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the
    value resulting from the conversion is correctly rounded.
6   In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be
    accepted.
7   If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion is
    performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
    that endptr is not a null pointer.
    Recommended practice
8   If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form, FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, and
    the result is not exactly representable, the result should be one of the two numbers in the
    appropriate internal format that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value,
    with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding
    direction.
9   If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most DECIMAL_DIG (defined in
    <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a>) significant digits, the result should be correctly rounded. If the subject
    sequence D has the decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG significant digits,
    consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal strings L and U, both having
    DECIMAL_DIG significant digits, such that the values of L, D, and U satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U.
    The result should be one of the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by
    correctly rounding L and U according to the current rounding direction, with the extra

    <sup><a name="note258" href="#note258"><b>258)</b></a></sup> It is unspecified whether a minus-signed sequence is converted to a negative number directly or by
         negating the value resulting from converting the corresponding unsigned sequence (see <a href="#F.5">F.5</a>); the two
         methods may yield different results if rounding is toward positive or negative infinity. In either case,
         the functions honor the sign of zero if floating-point arithmetic supports signed zeros.
    <sup><a name="note259" href="#note259"><b>259)</b></a></sup> An implementation may use the n-char sequence to determine extra information to be represented in

     rounding direction.<sup><a href="#note260"><b>260)</b></a></sup>
<b>     Returns</b>
10   The functions return the converted value, if any. If no conversion could be performed,
     zero is returned. If the correct value is outside the range of representable values, plus or
     minus HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL is returned (according to the return
     type and sign of the value), and the value of the macro ERANGE is stored in errno. If
     the result underflows (<a href="#7.12.1">7.12.1</a>), the functions return a value whose magnitude is no greater
     than the smallest normalized positive number in the return type; whether errno acquires
     the value ERANGE is implementation-defined.

     long int, and unsigned long long int representation, respectively. First,
     they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial, possibly empty, sequence of
     white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function), a subject sequence


     <sup><a name="note260" href="#note260"><b>260)</b></a></sup> DECIMAL_DIG, defined in <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a>, should be sufficiently large that L and U will usually round

    resembling an integer represented in some radix determined by the value of base, and a
    final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the terminating null
    character of the input string. Then, they attempt to convert the subject sequence to an
    integer, and return the result.
3   If the value of base is zero, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of an
    integer constant as described in <a href="#6.4.4.1">6.4.4.1</a>, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign, but
    not including an integer suffix. If the value of base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), the
    expected form of the subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits representing an
    integer with the radix specified by base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign,
    but not including an integer suffix. The letters from a (or A) through z (or Z) are
    ascribed the values 10 through 35; only letters and digits whose ascribed values are less
    than that of base are permitted. If the value of base is 16, the characters 0x or 0X may
    optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits, following the sign if present.
4   The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input string,
    starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of the expected form. The subject
    sequence contains no characters if the input string is empty or consists entirely of white
    space, or if the first non-white-space character is other than a sign or a permissible letter
    or digit.
5   If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is zero, the sequence
    of characters starting with the first digit is interpreted as an integer constant according to
    the rules of <a href="#6.4.4.1">6.4.4.1</a>. If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base
    is between 2 and 36, it is used as the base for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value
    as given above. If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from
    the conversion is negated (in the return type). A pointer to the final string is stored in the
    object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.
6   In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be
    accepted.
7   If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion is
    performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
    that endptr is not a null pointer.
<b>    Returns</b>
8   The strtol, strtoll, strtoul, and strtoull functions return the converted
    value, if any. If no conversion could be performed, zero is returned. If the correct value
    is outside the range of representable values, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX, LLONG_MIN,
    LLONG_MAX, ULONG_MAX, or ULLONG_MAX is returned (according to the return type
    and sign of the value, if any), and the value of the macro ERANGE is stored in errno.

<b>    Description</b>
2   If s is not a null pointer, the mbtowc function inspects at most n bytes beginning with
    the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes needed to complete the next
    multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the

    character, the function is left in the initial conversion state.

1          #include <a href="#7.21">&lt;string.h&gt;</a>
           char *strstr(const char *s1, const char *s2);
<b>    Description</b>
2   The strstr function locates the first occurrence in the string pointed to by s1 of the
    sequence of characters (excluding the terminating null character) in the string pointed to
    by s2.
<b>    Returns</b>
3   The strstr function returns a pointer to the located string, or a null pointer if the string
    is not found. If s2 points to a string with zero length, the function returns s1.
<a name="7.21.5.8" href="#7.21.5.8"><b>    7.21.5.8 The strtok function</b></a>
<b>    Synopsis</b>
1          #include <a href="#7.21">&lt;string.h&gt;</a>
           char *strtok(char * restrict s1,
                const char * restrict s2);
<b>    Description</b>
2   A sequence of calls to the strtok function breaks the string pointed to by s1 into a
    sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a character from the string pointed to
    by s2. The first call in the sequence has a non-null first argument; subsequent calls in the
    sequence have a null first argument. The separator string pointed to by s2 may be
    different from call to call.
3   The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by s1 for the first character
    that is not contained in the current separator string pointed to by s2. If no such character
    is found, then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by s1 and the strtok function

[<a name="p332" href="#p332">page 332</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    returns a null pointer. If such a character is found, it is the start of the first token.
4   The strtok function then searches from there for a character that is contained in the
    current separator string. If no such character is found, the current token extends to the
    end of the string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches for a token will return a null
    pointer. If such a character is found, it is overwritten by a null character, which
    terminates the current token. The strtok function saves a pointer to the following
    character, from which the next search for a token will start.
5   Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the first argument, starts
    searching from the saved pointer and behaves as described above.
6   The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the strtok function.
<b>    Returns</b>
7   The strtok function returns a pointer to the first character of a token, or a null pointer
    if there is no token.

2   Of the <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> and <a href="#7.3">&lt;complex.h&gt;</a> functions without an f (float) or l (long

3   Use of the macro invokes a function whose generic parameters have the corresponding

    -- Otherwise, if any argument for generic parameters has type double or is of integer

1   The header <a href="#7.23">&lt;time.h&gt;</a> defines two macros, and declares several types and functions for
    manipulating time. Many functions deal with a calendar time that represents the current
    date (according to the Gregorian calendar) and time. Some functions deal with local
    time, which is the calendar time expressed for some specific time zone, and with Daylight
    Saving Time, which is a temporary change in the algorithm for determining local time.
    The local time zone and Daylight Saving Time are implementation-defined.
2   The macros defined are NULL (described in <a href="#7.17">7.17</a>); and
            CLOCKS_PER_SEC
    which expands to an expression with type clock_t (described below) that is the
    number per second of the value returned by the clock function.
3   The types declared are size_t (described in <a href="#7.17">7.17</a>);
            clock_t
    and
            time_t
    which are arithmetic types capable of representing times; and
            struct tm
    which holds the components of a calendar time, called the broken-down time.
4   The range and precision of times representable in clock_t and time_t are
    implementation-defined. The tm structure shall contain at least the following members,
    in any order. The semantics of the members and their normal ranges are expressed in the

    any of the functions that return a pointer to one of these object types may overwrite the
    information in any object of the same type pointed to by the value returned from any
    previous call to any of them. The implementation shall behave as if no other library

<b>    Description</b>
2   The strftime function places characters into the array pointed to by s as controlled by
    the string pointed to by format. The format shall be a multibyte character sequence,
    beginning and ending in its initial shift state. The format string consists of zero or
    more conversion specifiers and ordinary multibyte characters. A conversion specifier
    consists of a % character, possibly followed by an E or O modifier character (described
    below), followed by a character that determines the behavior of the conversion specifier.
    All ordinary multibyte characters (including the terminating null character) are copied

[<a name="p343" href="#p343">page 343</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    unchanged into the array. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
    behavior is undefined. No more than maxsize characters are placed into the array.
3   Each conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters as described in the
    following list. The appropriate characters are determined using the LC_TIME category
    of the current locale and by the values of zero or more members of the broken-down time
    structure pointed to by timeptr, as specified in brackets in the description. If any of
    the specified values is outside the normal range, the characters stored are unspecified.

    %Z   is replaced by the locale's time zone name or abbreviation, or by no characters if no
         time zone is determinable. [tm_isdst]
    %%   is replaced by %.
4   Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the inclusion of an E or O modifier
    character to indicate an alternative format or specification. If the alternative format or
    specification does not exist for the current locale, the modifier is ignored.
    %Ec is replaced by the locale's alternative date and time representation.
    %EC is replaced by the name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative
        representation.
    %Ex is replaced by the locale's alternative date representation.

        (filled as needed with leading zeros, or with leading spaces if there is no alternative
        symbol for zero).
    %Oe is replaced by the day of the month, using the locale's alternative numeric symbols
        (filled as needed with leading spaces).
    %OH is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock), using the locale's alternative numeric
        symbols.

[<a name="p345" href="#p345">page 345</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    %OI is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock), using the locale's alternative numeric
        symbols.
    %Om is replaced by the month, using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.
    %OM is replaced by the minutes, using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.
    %OS is replaced by the seconds, using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

        symbols.
5   %g, %G, and %V give values according to the ISO 8601 week-based year. In this system,
    weeks begin on a Monday and week 1 of the year is the week that includes January 4th,
    which is also the week that includes the first Thursday of the year, and is also the first
    week that contains at least four days in the year. If the first Monday of January is the
    2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days are part of the last week of the preceding year; thus,
    for Saturday 2nd January 1999, %G is replaced by 1998 and %V is replaced by 53. If
    December 29th, 30th, or 31st is a Monday, it and any following days are part of week 1 of
    the following year. Thus, for Tuesday 30th December 1997, %G is replaced by 1998 and
    %V is replaced by 01.
6   If a conversion specifier is not one of the above, the behavior is undefined.
7   In the "C" locale, the E and O modifiers are ignored and the replacement strings for the
    following specifiers are:
    %a    the first three characters of %A.
    %A    one of ''Sunday'', ''Monday'', ... , ''Saturday''.
    %b    the first three characters of %B.
    %B    one of ''January'', ''February'', ... , ''December''.
    %c    equivalent to ''%a %b %e %T %Y''.
    %p    one of ''AM'' or ''PM''.
    %r    equivalent to ''%I:%M:%S %p''.
    %x    equivalent to ''%m/%d/%y''.
    %X    equivalent to %T.
    %Z    implementation-defined.

<b>    Synopsis</b>

            int fwprintf(FILE * restrict stream,
                 const wchar_t * restrict format, ...);
<b>    Description</b>
2   The fwprintf function writes output to the stream pointed to by stream, under
    control of the wide string pointed to by format that specifies how subsequent arguments
    are converted for output. If there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behavior
    is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments
    are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored. The fwprintf function returns
    when the end of the format string is encountered.
3   The format is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary wide characters (not %),
    which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of
    which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments, converting them, if
    applicable, according to the corresponding conversion specifier, and then writing the
    result to the output stream.
4   Each conversion specification is introduced by the wide character %. After the %, the
    following appear in sequence:
    -- Zero or more flags (in any order) that modify the meaning of the conversion
      specification.
    -- An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer wide characters
      than the field width, it is padded with spaces (by default) on the left (or right, if the

        left adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the field width. The field
        width takes the form of an asterisk * (described later) or a nonnegative decimal
        integer.<sup><a href="#note281"><b>281)</b></a></sup>
    -- An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the d, i,
      o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point
      wide character for a, A, e, E, f, and F conversions, the maximum number of
      significant digits for the g and G conversions, or the maximum number of wide
      characters to be written for s conversions. The precision takes the form of a period
      (.) followed either by an asterisk * (described later) or by an optional decimal
      integer; if only the period is specified, the precision is taken as zero. If a precision
      appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.
    -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the argument.
    -- A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type of conversion to be
      applied.
5   As noted above, a field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an asterisk. In
    this case, an int argument supplies the field width or precision. The arguments
    specifying field width, or precision, or both, shall appear (in that order) before the
    argument (if any) to be converted. A negative field width argument is taken as a - flag
    followed by a positive field width. A negative precision argument is taken as if the
    precision were omitted.
6   The flag wide characters and their meanings are:
    -        The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
             this flag is not specified.)
    +        The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
             begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
             specified.)<sup><a href="#note282"><b>282)</b></a></sup>
    space If the first wide character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed
          conversion results in no wide characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the
          space and + flags both appear, the space flag is ignored.
    #        The result is converted to an ''alternative form''. For o conversion, it increases
             the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
             zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x (or X)
             conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g,

    <sup><a name="note281" href="#note281"><b>281)</b></a></sup> Note that 0 is taken as a flag, not as the beginning of a field width.
    <sup><a name="note282" href="#note282"><b>282)</b></a></sup> The results of all floating conversions of a negative zero, and of negative values that round to zero,
         include a minus sign.

              and G conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
              contains a decimal-point wide character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a
              decimal-point wide character appears in the result of these conversions only if a
              digit follows it.) For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
              result. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
    0         For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, leading zeros
              (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather
              than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the
              0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X
              conversions, if a precision is specified, the 0 flag is ignored. For other
              conversions, the behavior is undefined.
7   The length modifiers and their meanings are:
    hh             Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a
                   signed char or unsigned char argument (the argument will have

                   short int or unsigned short int argument (the argument will
                   have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value shall
                   be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing);
                   or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a short

    j              Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to
                   an intmax_t or uintmax_t argument; or that a following n conversion
                   specifier applies to a pointer to an intmax_t argument.

    L           Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier
                applies to a long double argument.
    If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above,
    the behavior is undefined.
8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i        The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [-]dddd. The
               precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
               being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
               leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
               value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.
    o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
            decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd; the
            letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
            conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
            if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
            with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
            zero value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.
    f,F        A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
               decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
               the decimal-point wide character is equal to the precision specification. If the
               precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
               not specified, no decimal-point wide character appears. If a decimal-point
               wide character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is
               rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
               A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
               [-]inf or [-]infinity -- which style is implementation-defined. A
               double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
               [-]nan or [-]nan(n-wchar-sequence) -- which style, and the meaning of
               any n-wchar-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion
               specifier produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or

[<a name="p352" href="#p352">page 352</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

             nan, respectively.<sup><a href="#note283"><b>283)</b></a></sup>
e,E          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
             style [-]d.ddd e(+-)dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
             argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point wide character and the number
             of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken
             as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
             wide character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of
             digits. The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
             introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
             and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
             value is zero, the exponent is zero.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
g,G          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
             style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
             depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
             precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
             Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X :
             -- if P &gt; X &gt;= -4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
               P - (X + 1).
             -- otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P - 1.
             Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the
             fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point wide character is
             removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
a,A          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
             style [-]0xh.hhhh p(+-)d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
             nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
             otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point wide character<sup><a href="#note284"><b>284)</b></a></sup> and the
             number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision
             is missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient


<sup><a name="note283" href="#note283"><b>283)</b></a></sup> When applied to infinite and NaN values, the -, +, and space flag wide characters have their usual
     meaning; the # and 0 flag wide characters have no effect.
<sup><a name="note284" href="#note284"><b>284)</b></a></sup> Binary implementations can choose the hexadecimal digit to the left of the decimal-point wide
     character so that subsequent digits align to nibble (4-bit) boundaries.

             for an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
             FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
             distinguish<sup><a href="#note285"><b>285)</b></a></sup> values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
             omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
             point wide character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion
             and the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier
             produces a number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always
             contains at least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to
             represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is
             zero.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
c            If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to a wide
             character as if by calling btowc and the resulting wide character is written.
             If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted to
             wchar_t and written.
s            If no l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
             element of a character array containing a multibyte character sequence
             beginning in the initial shift state. Characters from the array are converted as
             if by repeated calls to the mbrtowc function, with the conversion state
             described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first
             multibyte character is converted, and written up to (but not including) the
             terminating null wide character. If the precision is specified, no more than
             that many wide characters are written. If the precision is not specified or is
             greater than the size of the converted array, the converted array shall contain a
             null wide character.
             If an l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
             element of an array of wchar_t type. Wide characters from the array are
             written up to (but not including) a terminating null wide character. If the
             precision is specified, no more than that many wide characters are written. If
             the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array
             shall contain a null wide character.
p            The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of the pointer is
             converted to a sequence of printing wide characters, in an implementation-

<sup><a name="note285" href="#note285"><b>285)</b></a></sup> The precision p is sufficient to distinguish values of the source type if 16 p-1 &gt; b n where b is
     FLT_RADIX and n is the number of base-b digits in the significand of the source type. A smaller p
     might suffice depending on the implementation's scheme for determining the digit to the left of the
     decimal-point wide character.

[<a name="p354" href="#p354">page 354</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

                    defined manner.
     n              The argument shall be a pointer to signed integer into which is written the
                    number of wide characters written to the output stream so far by this call to
                    fwprintf. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the
                    conversion specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the
                    behavior is undefined.
     %              A % wide character is written. No argument is converted. The complete
                    conversion specification shall be %%.
9    If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.<sup><a href="#note286"><b>286)</b></a></sup> If any argument is
     not the correct type for the corresponding conversion specification, the behavior is
     undefined.
10   In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field; if the result
     of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is expanded to contain the
     conversion result.
11   For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the value is correctly rounded
     to a hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.
     Recommended practice
12   For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2 and the result is not exactly
     representable in the given precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent numbers
     in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra stipulation that the
     error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.
13   For e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, if the number of significant decimal digits is at most
     DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be correctly rounded.<sup><a href="#note287"><b>287)</b></a></sup> If the number of
     significant decimal digits is more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly
     representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be an exact
     representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two
     adjacent decimal strings L &lt; U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the value
     of the resultant decimal string D should satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U, with the extra stipulation that
     the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.
<b>     Returns</b>
14   The fwprintf function returns the number of wide characters transmitted, or a negative
     value if an output or encoding error occurred.

     <sup><a name="note287" href="#note287"><b>287)</b></a></sup> For binary-to-decimal conversion, the result format's values are the numbers representable with the

<b>     Synopsis</b>

            #include <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a>
            int fwscanf(FILE * restrict stream,
                 const wchar_t * restrict format, ...);
<b>     Description</b>
2    The fwscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under
     control of the wide string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input
     sequences and how they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments
     as pointers to the objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient
     arguments for the format, the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while
     arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise
     ignored.
3    The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space wide
     characters, an ordinary wide character (neither % nor a white-space wide character), or a
     conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the wide
     character %. After the %, the following appear in sequence:
     -- An optional assignment-suppressing wide character *.
     -- An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
       (in wide characters).

[<a name="p356" href="#p356">page 356</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

     -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
     -- A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type of conversion to be
       applied.
4    The fwscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails,
     as detailed below, the function returns. Failures are described as input failures (due to the
     occurrence of an encoding error or the unavailability of input characters), or matching
     failures (due to inappropriate input).
5    A directive composed of white-space wide character(s) is executed by reading input up to
     the first non-white-space wide character (which remains unread), or until no more wide
     characters can be read.
6    A directive that is an ordinary wide character is executed by reading the next wide
     character of the stream. If that wide character differs from the directive, the directive
     fails and the differing and subsequent wide characters remain unread. Similarly, if end-
     of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a wide character from being read, the
     directive fails.
7    A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as
     described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the
     following steps:
8    Input white-space wide characters (as specified by the iswspace function) are skipped,
     unless the specification includes a [, c, or n specifier.<sup><a href="#note288"><b>288)</b></a></sup>
9    An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an n specifier. An
     input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide characters which does not
     exceed any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching input
     sequence.<sup><a href="#note289"><b>289)</b></a></sup> The first wide character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the
     length of the input item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a
     matching failure unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input
     from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.
10   Except in the case of a % specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a %n directive, the
     count of input wide characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion
     specifier. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails:
     this condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a *,
     the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument
     following the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this


     <sup><a name="note288" href="#note288"><b>288)</b></a></sup> These white-space wide characters are not counted against a specified field width.
     <sup><a name="note289" href="#note289"><b>289)</b></a></sup> fwscanf pushes back at most one input wide character onto the input stream. Therefore, some
          sequences that are acceptable to wcstod, wcstol, etc., are unacceptable to fwscanf.

12   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
     d          Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as
                expected for the subject sequence of the wcstol function with the value 10
                for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to

     i          Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as expected
                for the subject sequence of the wcstol function with the value 0 for the
                base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to signed

[<a name="p358" href="#p358">page 358</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

            integer.
o           Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as
            expected for the subject sequence of the wcstoul function with the value 8
            for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
            unsigned integer.
u           Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as
            expected for the subject sequence of the wcstoul function with the value 10
            for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
            unsigned integer.
x           Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same
            as expected for the subject sequence of the wcstoul function with the value
            16 for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
            unsigned integer.
a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose
        format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the wcstod
        function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to floating.
c           Matches a sequence of wide characters of exactly the number specified by the
            field width (1 if no field width is present in the directive).
            If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
            converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
            conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
            before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
            shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
            accept the sequence. No null character is added.
            If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
            pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
            the sequence. No null wide character is added.
s           Matches a sequence of non-white-space wide characters.
            If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
            converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
            conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
            before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
            shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
            accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added
            automatically.
            If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
            pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept

[<a name="p359" href="#p359">page 359</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

         the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be added
         automatically.
[        Matches a nonempty sequence of wide characters from a set of expected
         characters (the scanset).
         If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
         converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
         conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
         before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
         shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
         accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added
         automatically.
         If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
         pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
         the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be added
         automatically.
         The conversion specifier includes all subsequent wide characters in the
         format string, up to and including the matching right bracket (]). The wide
         characters between the brackets (the scanlist) compose the scanset, unless the
         wide character after the left bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the
         scanset contains all wide characters that do not appear in the scanlist between
         the circumflex and the right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with
         [] or [^], the right bracket wide character is in the scanlist and the next
         following right bracket wide character is the matching right bracket that ends
         the specification; otherwise the first following right bracket wide character is
         the one that ends the specification. If a - wide character is in the scanlist and
         is not the first, nor the second where the first wide character is a ^, nor the
         last character, the behavior is implementation-defined.
p        Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
         same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
         the fwprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
         pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
         implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
         during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
         equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.
n        No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
         signed integer into which is to be written the number of wide characters read
         from the input stream so far by this call to the fwscanf function. Execution
         of a %n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
         completion of execution of the fwscanf function. No argument is

[<a name="p360" href="#p360">page 360</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

                    converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an
                    assignment-suppressing wide character or a field width, the behavior is
                    undefined.
     %              Matches a single % wide character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
                    complete conversion specification shall be %%.
13   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.<sup><a href="#note290"><b>290)</b></a></sup>
14   The conversion specifiers A, E, F, G, and X are also valid and behave the same as,
     respectively, a, e, f, g, and x.
15   Trailing white space (including new-line wide characters) is left unread unless matched
     by a directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is not directly
     determinable other than via the %n directive.
<b>     Returns</b>
16   The fwscanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
     before any conversion. Otherwise, the function returns the number of input items
     assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early
     matching failure.

     will assign to i the value 56 and to x the value 789.0, will skip past 0123, and will assign to y the value
     56.0. The next wide character read from the input stream will be a.

<b>    Description</b>
2   If the end-of-file indicator for the input stream pointed to by stream is not set and a
    next wide character is present, the fgetwc function obtains that wide character as a
    wchar_t converted to a wint_t and advances the associated file position indicator for
    the stream (if defined).
<b>    Returns</b>
3   If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-
    of-file indicator for the stream is set and the fgetwc function returns WEOF. Otherwise,
    the fgetwc function returns the next wide character from the input stream pointed to by
    stream. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set and the fgetwc
    function returns WEOF. If an encoding error occurs (including too few bytes), the value of
    the macro EILSEQ is stored in errno and the fgetwc function returns WEOF.<sup><a href="#note292"><b>292)</b></a></sup>

<b>    Description</b>
2   The ungetwc function pushes the wide character specified by c back onto the input

[<a name="p370" href="#p370">page 370</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a file positioning function
    (fseek, fsetpos, or rewind) discards any pushed-back wide characters for the
    stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
3   One wide character of pushback is guaranteed, even if the call to the ungetwc function
    follows just after a call to a formatted wide character input function fwscanf,
    vfwscanf, vwscanf, or wscanf. If the ungetwc function is called too many times
    on the same stream without an intervening read or file positioning operation on that

4   If the value of c equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation fails and the input stream is
    unchanged.
5   A successful call to the ungetwc function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream.
    The value of the file position indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all
    pushed-back wide characters is the same as it was before the wide characters were pushed
    back. For a text or binary stream, the value of its file position indicator after a successful
    call to the ungetwc function is unspecified until all pushed-back wide characters are

2   Where an argument declared as size_t n determines the length of the array for a
    function, n can have the value zero on a call to that function. Unless explicitly stated
    otherwise in the description of a particular function in this subclause, pointer arguments

<b>    Description</b>
2   The wcstod, wcstof, and wcstold functions convert the initial portion of the wide
    string pointed to by nptr to double, float, and long double representation,
    respectively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial, possibly
    empty, sequence of white-space wide characters (as specified by the iswspace
    function), a subject sequence resembling a floating-point constant or representing an
    infinity or NaN; and a final wide string of one or more unrecognized wide characters,
    including the terminating null wide character of the input wide string. Then, they attempt
    to convert the subject sequence to a floating-point number, and return the result.
3   The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional plus or minus sign, then one of
    the following:
    -- a nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point wide
      character, then an optional exponent part as defined for the corresponding single-byte
      characters in <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>;
    -- a 0x or 0X, then a nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a
      decimal-point wide character, then an optional binary exponent part as defined in
      <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>;
    -- INF or INFINITY, or any other wide string equivalent except for case
    -- NAN or NAN(n-wchar-sequenceopt), or any other wide string equivalent except for
      case in the NAN part, where:
               n-wchar-sequence:
                     digit
                     nondigit
                     n-wchar-sequence digit
                     n-wchar-sequence nondigit
    The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input wide
    string, starting with the first non-white-space wide character, that is of the expected form.

[<a name="p372" href="#p372">page 372</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    The subject sequence contains no wide characters if the input wide string is not of the
    expected form.
4   If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point number, the sequence of
    wide characters starting with the first digit or the decimal-point wide character
    (whichever occurs first) is interpreted as a floating constant according to the rules of
    <a href="#6.4.4.2">6.4.4.2</a>, except that the decimal-point wide character is used in place of a period, and that
    if neither an exponent part nor a decimal-point wide character appears in a decimal
    floating point number, or if a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal
    floating point number, an exponent part of the appropriate type with value zero is
    assumed to follow the last digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins with a minus
    sign, the sequence is interpreted as negated.<sup><a href="#note294"><b>294)</b></a></sup> A wide character sequence INF or
    INFINITY is interpreted as an infinity, if representable in the return type, else like a
    floating constant that is too large for the range of the return type. A wide character
    sequence NAN or NAN(n-wchar-sequenceopt) is interpreted as a quiet NaN, if supported
    in the return type, else like a subject sequence part that does not have the expected form;
    the meaning of the n-wchar sequences is implementation-defined.<sup><a href="#note295"><b>295)</b></a></sup> A pointer to the
    final wide string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is
    not a null pointer.
5   If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the
    value resulting from the conversion is correctly rounded.
6   In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be
    accepted.
7   If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion is
    performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
    that endptr is not a null pointer.
    Recommended practice
8   If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form, FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, and
    the result is not exactly representable, the result should be one of the two numbers in the
    appropriate internal format that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value,
    with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding
    direction.



    <sup><a name="note294" href="#note294"><b>294)</b></a></sup> It is unspecified whether a minus-signed sequence is converted to a negative number directly or by
         negating the value resulting from converting the corresponding unsigned sequence (see <a href="#F.5">F.5</a>); the two
         methods may yield different results if rounding is toward positive or negative infinity. In either case,
         the functions honor the sign of zero if floating-point arithmetic supports signed zeros.
    <sup><a name="note295" href="#note295"><b>295)</b></a></sup> An implementation may use the n-wchar sequence to determine extra information to be represented in
         the NaN's significand.

[<a name="p373" href="#p373">page 373</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

9    If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most DECIMAL_DIG (defined in
     <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a>) significant digits, the result should be correctly rounded. If the subject
     sequence D has the decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG significant digits,
     consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal strings L and U, both having
     DECIMAL_DIG significant digits, such that the values of L, D, and U satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U.
     The result should be one of the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by
     correctly rounding L and U according to the current rounding direction, with the extra
     stipulation that the error with respect to D should have a correct sign for the current
     rounding direction.<sup><a href="#note296"><b>296)</b></a></sup>
<b>     Returns</b>
10   The functions return the converted value, if any. If no conversion could be performed,
     zero is returned. If the correct value is outside the range of representable values, plus or
     minus HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL is returned (according to the return
     type and sign of the value), and the value of the macro ERANGE is stored in errno. If
     the result underflows (<a href="#7.12.1">7.12.1</a>), the functions return a value whose magnitude is no greater
     than the smallest normalized positive number in the return type; whether errno acquires
     the value ERANGE is implementation-defined.




     <sup><a name="note296" href="#note296"><b>296)</b></a></sup> DECIMAL_DIG, defined in <a href="#7.7">&lt;float.h&gt;</a>, should be sufficiently large that L and U will usually round
          to the same internal floating value, but if not will round to adjacent values.

<b>    Description</b>

    portion of the wide string pointed to by nptr to long int, long long int,
    unsigned long int, and unsigned long long int representation,
    respectively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial, possibly
    empty, sequence of white-space wide characters (as specified by the iswspace
    function), a subject sequence resembling an integer represented in some radix determined
    by the value of base, and a final wide string of one or more unrecognized wide
    characters, including the terminating null wide character of the input wide string. Then,
    they attempt to convert the subject sequence to an integer, and return the result.
3   If the value of base is zero, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of an
    integer constant as described for the corresponding single-byte characters in <a href="#6.4.4.1">6.4.4.1</a>,
    optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign, but not including an integer suffix. If the
    value of base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), the expected form of the subject sequence
    is a sequence of letters and digits representing an integer with the radix specified by
    base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign, but not including an integer suffix.
    The letters from a (or A) through z (or Z) are ascribed the values 10 through 35; only
    letters and digits whose ascribed values are less than that of base are permitted. If the
    value of base is 16, the wide characters 0x or 0X may optionally precede the sequence
    of letters and digits, following the sign if present.

[<a name="p375" href="#p375">page 375</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

4   The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input wide
    string, starting with the first non-white-space wide character, that is of the expected form.
    The subject sequence contains no wide characters if the input wide string is empty or
    consists entirely of white space, or if the first non-white-space wide character is other
    than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.
5   If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is zero, the sequence
    of wide characters starting with the first digit is interpreted as an integer constant
    according to the rules of <a href="#6.4.4.1">6.4.4.1</a>. If the subject sequence has the expected form and the
    value of base is between 2 and 36, it is used as the base for conversion, ascribing to each
    letter its value as given above. If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value
    resulting from the conversion is negated (in the return type). A pointer to the final wide
    string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null
    pointer.
6   In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be
    accepted.
7   If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion is
    performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
    that endptr is not a null pointer.
<b>    Returns</b>

    LLONG_MAX, ULONG_MAX, or ULLONG_MAX is returned (according to the return type
    sign of the value, if any), and the value of the macro ERANGE is stored in errno.

                wchar_t ** restrict ptr);
<b>    Description</b>
2   A sequence of calls to the wcstok function breaks the wide string pointed to by s1 into
    a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a wide character from the wide string
    pointed to by s2. The third argument points to a caller-provided wchar_t pointer into
    which the wcstok function stores information necessary for it to continue scanning the
    same wide string.
3   The first call in a sequence has a non-null first argument and stores an initial value in the
    object pointed to by ptr. Subsequent calls in the sequence have a null first argument and
    the object pointed to by ptr is required to have the value stored by the previous call in
    the sequence, which is then updated. The separator wide string pointed to by s2 may be
    different from call to call.
4   The first call in the sequence searches the wide string pointed to by s1 for the first wide
    character that is not contained in the current separator wide string pointed to by s2. If no
    such wide character is found, then there are no tokens in the wide string pointed to by s1
    and the wcstok function returns a null pointer. If such a wide character is found, it is
    the start of the first token.
5   The wcstok function then searches from there for a wide character that is contained in
    the current separator wide string. If no such wide character is found, the current token

[<a name="p383" href="#p383">page 383</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    extends to the end of the wide string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches in the
    same wide string for a token return a null pointer. If such a wide character is found, it is
    overwritten by a null wide character, which terminates the current token.
6   In all cases, the wcstok function stores sufficient information in the pointer pointed to
    by ptr so that subsequent calls, with a null pointer for s1 and the unmodified pointer
    value for ptr, shall start searching just past the element overwritten by a null wide
    character (if any).
<b>    Returns</b>
7   The wcstok function returns a pointer to the first wide character of a token, or a null
    pointer if there is no token.

<a name="7.24.6" href="#7.24.6"><b>    7.24.6 Extended multibyte/wide character conversion utilities</b></a>
1   The header <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a> declares an extended set of functions useful for conversion
    between multibyte characters and wide characters.
2   Most of the following functions -- those that are listed as ''restartable'', <a href="#7.24.6.3">7.24.6.3</a> and
    <a href="#7.24.6.4">7.24.6.4</a> -- take as a last argument a pointer to an object of type mbstate_t that is used
    to describe the current conversion state from a particular multibyte character sequence to
    a wide character sequence (or the reverse) under the rules of a particular setting for the
    LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
3   The initial conversion state corresponds, for a conversion in either direction, to the
    beginning of a new multibyte character in the initial shift state. A zero-valued
    mbstate_t object is (at least) one way to describe an initial conversion state. A zero-
    valued mbstate_t object can be used to initiate conversion involving any multibyte
    character sequence, in any LC_CTYPE category setting. If an mbstate_t object has
    been altered by any of the functions described in this subclause, and is then used with a
    different multibyte character sequence, or in the other conversion direction, or with a
    different LC_CTYPE category setting than on earlier function calls, the behavior is
    undefined.<sup><a href="#note299"><b>299)</b></a></sup>
4   On entry, each function takes the described conversion state (either internal or pointed to
    by an argument) as current. The conversion state described by the pointed-to object is
    altered as needed to track the shift state, and the position within a multibyte character, for
    the associated multibyte character sequence.




    <sup><a name="note299" href="#note299"><b>299)</b></a></sup> Thus, a particular mbstate_t object can be used, for example, with both the mbrtowc and
         mbsrtowcs functions as long as they are used to step sequentially through the same multibyte
         character string.

<a name="7.24.6.3" href="#7.24.6.3"><b>    7.24.6.3 Restartable multibyte/wide character conversion functions</b></a>
1   These functions differ from the corresponding multibyte character functions of <a href="#7.20.7">7.20.7</a>
    (mblen, mbtowc, and wctomb) in that they have an extra parameter, ps, of type

    each function uses its own internal mbstate_t object instead, which is initialized at
    program startup to the initial conversion state. The implementation behaves as if no
    library function calls these functions with a null pointer for ps.
2   Also unlike their corresponding functions, the return value does not represent whether the

2   If s is a null pointer, the mbrtowc function is equivalent to the call:

    In this case, the values of the parameters pwc and n are ignored.
3   If s is not a null pointer, the mbrtowc function inspects at most n bytes beginning with
    the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes needed to complete the next
    multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the
    next multibyte character is complete and valid, it determines the value of the
    corresponding wide character and then, if pwc is not a null pointer, stores that value in
    the object pointed to by pwc. If the corresponding wide character is the null wide
    character, the resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
<b>    Returns</b>
4   The mbrtowc function returns the first of the following that applies (given the current
    conversion state):
    0                     if the next n or fewer bytes complete the multibyte character that
                          corresponds to the null wide character (which is the value stored).
    between 1 and n inclusive if the next n or fewer bytes complete a valid multibyte
                       character (which is the value stored); the value returned is the number
                       of bytes that complete the multibyte character.
    (size_t)(-2) if the next n bytes contribute to an incomplete (but potentially valid)
                 multibyte character, and all n bytes have been processed (no value is
                 stored).<sup><a href="#note300"><b>300)</b></a></sup>
    (size_t)(-1) if an encoding error occurs, in which case the next n or fewer bytes
                 do not contribute to a complete and valid multibyte character (no
                 value is stored); the value of the macro EILSEQ is stored in errno,
                 and the conversion state is unspecified.

    <sup><a name="note300" href="#note300"><b>300)</b></a></sup> When n has at least the value of the MB_CUR_MAX macro, this case can only occur if s points at a

<b>    Description</b>
2   If s is a null pointer, the wcrtomb function is equivalent to the call
                    wcrtomb(buf, L'\0', ps)
    where buf is an internal buffer.
3   If s is not a null pointer, the wcrtomb function determines the number of bytes needed
    to represent the multibyte character that corresponds to the wide character given by wc
    (including any shift sequences), and stores the multibyte character representation in the
    array whose first element is pointed to by s. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes are stored. If
    wc is a null wide character, a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift sequence needed
    to restore the initial shift state; the resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
<b>    Returns</b>
4   The wcrtomb function returns the number of bytes stored in the array object (including
    any shift sequences). When wc is not a valid wide character, an encoding error occurs:
    the function stores the value of the macro EILSEQ in errno and returns
    (size_t)(-1); the conversion state is unspecified.
<a name="7.24.6.4" href="#7.24.6.4"><b>    7.24.6.4 Restartable multibyte/wide string conversion functions</b></a>
1   These functions differ from the corresponding multibyte string functions of <a href="#7.20.8">7.20.8</a>
    (mbstowcs and wcstombs) in that they have an extra parameter, ps, of type pointer to

    uses its own internal mbstate_t object instead, which is initialized at program startup
    to the initial conversion state. The implementation behaves as if no library function calls
    these functions with a null pointer for ps.
2   Also unlike their corresponding functions, the conversion source parameter, src, has a
    pointer-to-pointer type. When the function is storing the results of conversions (that is,
    when dst is not a null pointer), the pointer object pointed to by this parameter is updated
    to reflect the amount of the source processed by that invocation.

    continues up to and including a terminating null character, which is also stored.
    Conversion stops earlier in two cases: when a sequence of bytes is encountered that does

3   If dst is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by src is assigned either a null

    just past the last multibyte character converted (if any). If conversion stopped due to
    reaching a terminating null character and if dst is not a null pointer, the resulting state
    described is the initial conversion state.
<b>    Returns</b>
4   If the input conversion encounters a sequence of bytes that do not form a valid multibyte
    character, an encoding error occurs: the mbsrtowcs function stores the value of the

                          IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic
<a name="F.1" href="#F.1"><b>    F.1 Introduction</b></a>
1   This annex specifies C language support for the IEC 60559 floating-point standard. The
    IEC 60559 floating-point standard is specifically Binary floating-point arithmetic for
    microprocessor systems, second edition (IEC 60559:1989), previously designated
    IEC 559:1989 and as IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic
    (ANSI/IEEE 754-1985). IEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point
    Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE 854-1987) generalizes the binary standard to remove
    dependencies on radix and word length. IEC 60559 generally refers to the floating-point
    standard, as in IEC 60559 operation, IEC 60559 format, etc. An implementation that
    defines __STDC_IEC_559__ shall conform to the specifications in this annex. Where
    a binding between the C language and IEC 60559 is indicated, the IEC 60559-specified
    behavior is adopted by reference, unless stated otherwise.
<a name="F.2" href="#F.2"><b>    F.2 Types</b></a>
1   The C floating types match the IEC 60559 formats as follows:
    -- The float type matches the IEC 60559 single format.
    -- The double type matches the IEC 60559 double format.
    -- The long double type matches an IEC 60559 extended format,<sup><a href="#note307"><b>307)</b></a></sup> else a
      non-IEC 60559 extended format, else the IEC 60559 double format.
    Any non-IEC 60559 extended format used for the long double type shall have more
    precision than IEC 60559 double and at least the range of IEC 60559 double.<sup><a href="#note308"><b>308)</b></a></sup>
    Recommended practice
2   The long double type should match an IEC 60559 extended format.




    <sup><a name="note307" href="#note307"><b>307)</b></a></sup> ''Extended'' is IEC 60559's double-extended data format. Extended refers to both the common 80-bit
         and quadruple 128-bit IEC 60559 formats.
    <sup><a name="note308" href="#note308"><b>308)</b></a></sup> A non-IEC 60559 long double type is required to provide infinity and NaNs, as its values include
         all double values.

[<a name="p444" href="#p444">page 444</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

<a name="F.2.1" href="#F.2.1"><b>    F.2.1 Infinities, signed zeros, and NaNs</b></a>
1   This specification does not define the behavior of signaling NaNs.<sup><a href="#note309"><b>309)</b></a></sup> It generally uses
    the term NaN to denote quiet NaNs. The NAN and INFINITY macros and the nan
    functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide designations for IEC 60559 NaNs and infinities.
<a name="F.3" href="#F.3"><b>    F.3 Operators and functions</b></a>
1   C operators and functions provide IEC 60559 required and recommended facilities as
    listed below.
    -- The +, -, *, and / operators provide the IEC 60559 add, subtract, multiply, and
      divide operations.
    -- The sqrt functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the IEC 60559 square root operation.
    -- The remainder functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the IEC 60559 remainder
      operation. The remquo functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the same operation but
      with additional information.
    -- The rint functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the IEC 60559 operation that rounds a
      floating-point number to an integer value (in the same precision). The nearbyint
      functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the nearbyinteger function recommended in the
      Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.
    -- The conversions for floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions between
      floating-point precisions.
    -- The conversions from integer to floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions
      from integer to floating point.
    -- The conversions from floating to integer types provide IEC 60559-like conversions
      but always round toward zero.
    -- The lrint and llrint functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the IEC 60559
      conversions, which honor the directed rounding mode, from floating point to the
      long int and long long int integer formats. The lrint and llrint
      functions can be used to implement IEC 60559 conversions from floating to other
      integer formats.
    -- The translation time conversion of floating constants and the strtod, strtof,
      strtold, fprintf, fscanf, and related library functions in <a href="#7.20">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</a>,
      <a href="#7.19">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>, and <a href="#7.24">&lt;wchar.h&gt;</a> provide IEC 60559 binary-decimal conversions. The
      strtold function in <a href="#7.20">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</a> provides the conv function recommended in the
      Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.

    <sup><a name="note309" href="#note309"><b>309)</b></a></sup> Since NaNs created by IEC 60559 operations are always quiet, quiet NaNs (along with infinities) are
         sufficient for closure of the arithmetic.

[<a name="p445" href="#p445">page 445</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

-- The relational and equality operators provide IEC 60559 comparisons. IEC 60559
  identifies a need for additional comparison predicates to facilitate writing code that
  accounts for NaNs. The comparison macros (isgreater, isgreaterequal,
  isless, islessequal, islessgreater, and isunordered) in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a>
  supplement the language operators to address this need. The islessgreater and
  isunordered macros provide respectively a quiet version of the &lt;&gt; predicate and
  the unordered predicate recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The feclearexcept, feraiseexcept, and fetestexcept functions in
  <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> provide the facility to test and alter the IEC 60559 floating-point
  exception status flags. The fegetexceptflag and fesetexceptflag
  functions in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> provide the facility to save and restore all five status flags at
  one time. These functions are used in conjunction with the type fexcept_t and the
  floating-point     exception      macros      (FE_INEXACT,         FE_DIVBYZERO,
  FE_UNDERFLOW, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_INVALID) also in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a>.
-- The fegetround and fesetround functions in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> provide the facility
  to select among the IEC 60559 directed rounding modes represented by the rounding
  direction macros in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> (FE_TONEAREST, FE_UPWARD, FE_DOWNWARD,
  FE_TOWARDZERO) and the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 of FLT_ROUNDS are the
  IEC 60559 directed rounding modes.
-- The fegetenv, feholdexcept, fesetenv, and feupdateenv functions in
  <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> provide a facility to manage the floating-point environment, comprising
  the IEC 60559 status flags and control modes.
-- The copysign functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the copysign function
  recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The unary minus (-) operator provides the minus (-) operation recommended in the
  Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The scalbn and scalbln functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the scalb function
  recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The logb functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the logb function recommended in the
  Appendix to IEC 60559, but following the newer specifications in ANSI/IEEE 854.
-- The nextafter and nexttoward functions in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provide the nextafter
  function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (but with a minor change to
  better handle signed zeros).
-- The isfinite macro in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provides the finite function recommended in
  the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The isnan macro in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a> provides the isnan function recommended in the
  Appendix to IEC 60559.

[<a name="p446" href="#p446">page 446</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    -- The signbit macro and the fpclassify macro in <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a>, used in
      conjunction with the number classification macros (FP_NAN, FP_INFINITE,
      FP_NORMAL, FP_SUBNORMAL, FP_ZERO), provide the facility of the class
      function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (except that the classification
      macros defined in <a href="#7.12.3">7.12.3</a> do not distinguish signaling from quiet NaNs).
<a name="F.4" href="#F.4"><b>    F.4 Floating to integer conversion</b></a>
1   If the floating value is infinite or NaN or if the integral part of the floating value exceeds
    the range of the integer type, then the ''invalid'' floating-point exception is raised and the
    resulting value is unspecified. Whether conversion of non-integer floating values whose
    integral part is within the range of the integer type raises the ''inexact'' floating-point
    exception is unspecified.<sup><a href="#note310"><b>310)</b></a></sup>
<a name="F.5" href="#F.5"><b>    F.5 Binary-decimal conversion</b></a>
1   Conversion from the widest supported IEC 60559 format to decimal with
    DECIMAL_DIG digits and back is the identity function.<sup><a href="#note311"><b>311)</b></a></sup>
2   Conversions involving IEC 60559 formats follow all pertinent recommended practice. In
    particular, conversion between any supported IEC 60559 format and decimal with
    DECIMAL_DIG or fewer significant digits is correctly rounded (honoring the current
    rounding mode), which assures that conversion from the widest supported IEC 60559
    format to decimal with DECIMAL_DIG digits and back is the identity function.
3   Functions such as strtod that convert character sequences to floating types honor the
    rounding direction. Hence, if the rounding direction might be upward or downward, the
    implementation cannot convert a minus-signed sequence by negating the converted
    unsigned sequence.




    <sup><a name="note310" href="#note310"><b>310)</b></a></sup> ANSI/IEEE 854, but not IEC 60559 (ANSI/IEEE 754), directly specifies that floating-to-integer
         conversions raise the ''inexact'' floating-point exception for non-integer in-range values. In those
         cases where it matters, library functions can be used to effect such conversions with or without raising
         the ''inexact'' floating-point exception. See rint, lrint, llrint, and nearbyint in
         <a href="#7.12">&lt;math.h&gt;</a>.
    <sup><a name="note311" href="#note311"><b>311)</b></a></sup> If the minimum-width IEC 60559 extended format (64 bits of precision) is supported,
         DECIMAL_DIG shall be at least 21. If IEC 60559 double (53 bits of precision) is the widest
         IEC 60559 format supported, then DECIMAL_DIG shall be at least 17. (By contrast, LDBL_DIG and
         DBL_DIG are 18 and 15, respectively, for these formats.)

[<a name="p447" href="#p447">page 447</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

<a name="F.6" href="#F.6"><b>    F.6 Contracted expressions</b></a>
1   A contracted expression treats infinities, NaNs, signed zeros, subnormals, and the
    rounding directions in a manner consistent with the basic arithmetic operations covered
    by IEC 60559.
    Recommended practice
2   A contracted expression should raise floating-point exceptions in a manner generally
    consistent with the basic arithmetic operations. A contracted expression should deliver
    the same value as its uncontracted counterpart, else should be correctly rounded (once).
<a name="F.7" href="#F.7"><b>    F.7 Floating-point environment</b></a>
1   The floating-point environment defined in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> includes the IEC 60559 floating-
    point exception status flags and directed-rounding control modes. It includes also
    IEC 60559 dynamic rounding precision and trap enablement modes, if the
    implementation supports them.<sup><a href="#note312"><b>312)</b></a></sup>
<a name="F.7.1" href="#F.7.1"><b>    F.7.1 Environment management</b></a>
1   IEC 60559 requires that floating-point operations implicitly raise floating-point exception
    status flags, and that rounding control modes can be set explicitly to affect result values of
    floating-point operations. When the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma (defined in
    <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a>) is ''on'', these changes to the floating-point state are treated as side effects
    which respect sequence points.<sup><a href="#note313"><b>313)</b></a></sup>
<a name="F.7.2" href="#F.7.2"><b>    F.7.2 Translation</b></a>
1   During translation the IEC 60559 default modes are in effect:
    -- The rounding direction mode is rounding to nearest.
    -- The rounding precision mode (if supported) is set so that results are not shortened.
    -- Trapping or stopping (if supported) is disabled on all floating-point exceptions.
    Recommended practice
2   The implementation should produce a diagnostic message for each translation-time




    <sup><a name="note312" href="#note312"><b>312)</b></a></sup> This specification does not require dynamic rounding precision nor trap enablement modes.
    <sup><a name="note313" href="#note313"><b>313)</b></a></sup> If the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma is ''off'', the implementation is free to assume the floating-
         point control modes will be the default ones and the floating-point status flags will not be tested,
         which allows certain optimizations (see <a href="#F.8">F.8</a>).

    <sup><a name="note314" href="#note314"><b>314)</b></a></sup> As floating constants are converted to appropriate internal representations at translation time, their
         conversion is subject to default rounding modes and raises no execution-time floating-point exceptions
         (even where the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is ''on''). Library functions, for example
         strtod, provide execution-time conversion of numeric strings.

         1.0/0.0 generate execution-time floating-point exceptions. The programmer can achieve the
         efficiency of translation-time evaluation through static initialization, such as

3   The static initialization of v raises no (execution-time) floating-point exceptions because its computation is
    done at translation time. The automatic initialization of u and w require an execution-time conversion to
    float of the wider value 1.1e75, which raises floating-point exceptions. The automatic initializations
    of x and y entail execution-time conversion; however, in some expression evaluation methods, the
    conversions is not to a narrower format, in which case no floating-point exception is raised.<sup><a href="#note316"><b>316)</b></a></sup> The
    automatic initialization of z entails execution-time conversion, but not to a narrower format, so no floating-
    point exception is raised. Note that the conversions of the floating constants 1.1e75 and 1.1e75f to
    their internal representations occur at translation time in all cases.




    <sup><a name="note316" href="#note316"><b>316)</b></a></sup> Use of float_t and double_t variables increases the likelihood of translation-time computation.
         For example, the automatic initialization
                   double_t x = 1.1e75;
          could be done at translation time, regardless of the expression evaluation method.

1   Operations defined in <a href="#6.5">6.5</a> and functions and macros defined for the standard libraries
    change floating-point status flags and control modes just as indicated by their
    specifications (including conformance to IEC 60559). They do not change flags or modes
    (so as to be detectable by the user) in any other cases.
2   If the argument to the feraiseexcept function in <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> represents IEC 60559
    valid coincident floating-point exceptions for atomic operations (namely ''overflow'' and
    ''inexact'', or ''underflow'' and ''inexact''), then ''overflow'' or ''underflow'' is raised
    before ''inexact''.
<a name="F.8" href="#F.8"><b>    F.8 Optimization</b></a>
1   This section identifies code transformations that might subvert IEC 60559-specified
    behavior, and others that do not.
<a name="F.8.1" href="#F.8.1"><b>    F.8.1 Global transformations</b></a>
1   Floating-point arithmetic operations and external function calls may entail side effects
    which optimization shall honor, at least where the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is
    ''on''. The flags and modes in the floating-point environment may be regarded as global
    variables; floating-point operations (+, *, etc.) implicitly read the modes and write the
    flags.
2   Concern about side effects may inhibit code motion and removal of seemingly useless
    code. For example, in
             #include <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a>
             #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
             void f(double x)
             {
                  /* ... */
                  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) x + 1;
                  /* ... */
             }
    x + 1 might raise floating-point exceptions, so cannot be removed. And since the loop
    body might not execute (maybe 0 &gt;= n), x + 1 cannot be moved out of the loop. (Of
    course these optimizations are valid if the implementation can rule out the nettlesome
    cases.)
3   This specification does not require support for trap handlers that maintain information
    about the order or count of floating-point exceptions. Therefore, between function calls,
    floating-point exceptions need not be precise: the actual order and number of occurrences
    of floating-point exceptions (&gt; 1) may vary from what the source code expresses. Thus,
    the preceding loop could be treated as

<a name="G.1" href="#G.1"><b>    G.1 Introduction</b></a>
1   This annex supplements <a href="#F">annex F</a> to specify complex arithmetic for compatibility with
    IEC 60559 real floating-point arithmetic. Although these specifications have been
    carefully designed, there is little existing practice to validate the design decisions.
    Therefore, these specifications are not normative, but should be viewed more as
    recommended          practice.       An         implementation        that     defines
    __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__ should conform to the specifications in this annex.
<a name="G.2" href="#G.2"><b>    G.2 Types</b></a>
1   There is a new keyword _Imaginary, which is used to specify imaginary types. It is
    used as a type specifier within declaration specifiers in the same way as _Complex is
    (thus, _Imaginary float is a valid type name).
2   There are three imaginary types, designated as float _Imaginary, double
    _Imaginary, and long double _Imaginary. The imaginary types (along with
    the real floating and complex types) are floating types.
3   For imaginary types, the corresponding real type is given by deleting the keyword
    _Imaginary from the type name.
4   Each imaginary type has the same representation and alignment requirements as the
    corresponding real type. The value of an object of imaginary type is the value of the real
    representation times the imaginary unit.
5   The imaginary type domain comprises the imaginary types.
<a name="G.3" href="#G.3"><b>    G.3 Conventions</b></a>
1   A complex or imaginary value with at least one infinite part is regarded as an infinity
    (even if its other part is a NaN). A complex or imaginary value is a finite number if each
    of its parts is a finite number (neither infinite nor NaN). A complex or imaginary value is
    a zero if each of its parts is a zero.

1   Conversions among imaginary types follow rules analogous to those for real floating
    types.
<a name="G.4.2" href="#G.4.2"><b>    G.4.2 Real and imaginary</b></a>
1   When a value of imaginary type is converted to a real type other than _Bool,<sup><a href="#note324"><b>324)</b></a></sup> the
    result is a positive zero.
2   When a value of real type is converted to an imaginary type, the result is a positive
    imaginary zero.
<a name="G.4.3" href="#G.4.3"><b>    G.4.3 Imaginary and complex</b></a>
1   When a value of imaginary type is converted to a complex type, the real part of the
    complex result value is a positive zero and the imaginary part of the complex result value
    is determined by the conversion rules for the corresponding real types.
2   When a value of complex type is converted to an imaginary type, the real part of the
    complex value is discarded and the value of the imaginary part is converted according to
    the conversion rules for the corresponding real types.
<a name="G.5" href="#G.5"><b>    G.5 Binary operators</b></a>
1   The following subclauses supplement <a href="#6.5">6.5</a> in order to specify the type of the result for an
    operation with an imaginary operand.
2   For most operand types, the value of the result of a binary operator with an imaginary or
    complex operand is completely determined, with reference to real arithmetic, by the usual
    mathematical formula. For some operand types, the usual mathematical formula is
    problematic because of its treatment of infinities and because of undue overflow or
    underflow; in these cases the result satisfies certain properties (specified in <a href="#G.5.1">G.5.1</a>), but is
    not completely determined.

<b>    Semantics</b>
1   If one operand has real type and the other operand has imaginary type, then the result has
    imaginary type. If both operands have imaginary type, then the result has real type. (If
    either operand has complex type, then the result has complex type.)
2   If the operands are not both complex, then the result and floating-point exception
    behavior of the * operator is defined by the usual mathematical formula:
           *                  u                   iv                 u + iv

           x                  xu                i(xv)            (xu) + i(xv)

           iy               i(yu)                -yv            (-yv) + i(yu)

           x + iy       (xu) + i(yu)        (-yv) + i(xv)
3   If the second operand is not complex, then the result and floating-point exception
    behavior of the / operator is defined by the usual mathematical formula:
           /                   u                       iv

           x                  x/u                 i(-x/v)

           iy               i(y/u)                     y/v

           x + iy       (x/u) + i(y/u)        (y/v) + i(-x/v)
4   The * and / operators satisfy the following infinity properties for all real, imaginary, and
    complex operands:<sup><a href="#note325"><b>325)</b></a></sup>
    -- if one operand is an infinity and the other operand is a nonzero finite number or an
      infinity, then the result of the * operator is an infinity;
    -- if the first operand is an infinity and the second operand is a finite number, then the
      result of the / operator is an infinity;
    -- if the first operand is a finite number and the second operand is an infinity, then the
      result of the / operator is a zero;




    <sup><a name="note325" href="#note325"><b>325)</b></a></sup> These properties are already implied for those cases covered in the tables, but are required for all cases
         (at least where the state for CX_LIMITED_RANGE is ''off'').

[<a name="p469" href="#p469">page 469</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    -- if the first operand is a nonzero finite number or an infinity and the second operand is
      a zero, then the result of the / operator is an infinity.
5   If both operands of the * operator are complex or if the second operand of the / operator
    is complex, the operator raises floating-point exceptions if appropriate for the calculation
    of the parts of the result, and may raise spurious floating-point exceptions.

9   Scaling the denominator alleviates the main overflow and underflow problem, which is more serious than
    for multiplication. In the spirit of the multiplication example above, this code does not defend against
    overflow and underflow in the calculation of the numerator. Scaling with the scalbn function, instead of
    with division, provides better roundoff characteristics.

8   For the other functions, the following subclauses specify behavior for special cases,
    including treatment of the ''invalid'' and ''divide-by-zero'' floating-point exceptions. For
    families of functions, the specifications apply to all of the functions even though only the
    principal function is shown. For a function f satisfying f (conj(z)) = conj( f (z)), the
    specifications for the upper half-plane imply the specifications for the lower half-plane; if
    the function f is also either even, f (-z) = f (z), or odd, f (-z) = - f (z), then the
    specifications for the first quadrant imply the specifications for the other three quadrants.
9   In the following subclauses, cis(y) is defined as cos(y) + i sin(y).

<a name="H.1" href="#H.1"><b>    H.1 Introduction</b></a>
1   This annex documents the extent to which the C language supports the ISO/IEC 10967-1
    standard for language-independent arithmetic (LIA-1). LIA-1 is more general than
    IEC 60559 (<a href="#F">annex F</a>) in that it covers integer and diverse floating-point arithmetics.
<a name="H.2" href="#H.2"><b>    H.2 Types</b></a>
1   The relevant C arithmetic types meet the requirements of LIA-1 types if an
    implementation adds notification of exceptional arithmetic operations and meets the 1
    unit in the last place (ULP) accuracy requirement (LIA-1 subclause <a href="#5.2.8">5.2.8</a>).
<a name="H.2.1" href="#H.2.1"><b>    H.2.1 Boolean type</b></a>
1   The LIA-1 data type Boolean is implemented by the C data type bool with values of
    true and false, all from <a href="#7.16">&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</a>.
<a name="H.2.2" href="#H.2.2"><b>    H.2.2 Integer types</b></a>
1   The signed C integer types int, long int, long long int, and the corresponding
    unsigned types are compatible with LIA-1. If an implementation adds support for the
    LIA-1 exceptional values ''integer_overflow'' and ''undefined'', then those types are
    LIA-1 conformant types. C's unsigned integer types are ''modulo'' in the LIA-1 sense
    in that overflows or out-of-bounds results silently wrap. An implementation that defines
    signed integer types as also being modulo need not detect integer overflow, in which case,
    only integer divide-by-zero need be detected.
2   The parameters for the integer data types can be accessed by the following:
    maxint        INT_MAX, LONG_MAX, LLONG_MAX, UINT_MAX, ULONG_MAX,
                  ULLONG_MAX
    minint        INT_MIN, LONG_MIN, LLONG_MIN
3   The parameter ''bounded'' is always true, and is not provided. The parameter ''minint''
    is always 0 for the unsigned types, and is not provided for those types.

1   The C floating-point types float, double, and long double are compatible with

    with LIA-1. An implementation that uses IEC 60559 floating-point formats and

<a name="H.2.3.3" href="#H.2.3.3"><b>    H.2.3.3 Rounding styles</b></a>
1   The C Standard requires all floating types to use the same radix and rounding style, so
    that only one identifier for each is provided to map to LIA-1.
2   The FLT_ROUNDS parameter can be used to indicate the LIA-1 rounding styles:
    truncate      FLT_ROUNDS == 0

[<a name="p483" href="#p483">page 483</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    nearest        FLT_ROUNDS == 1
    other          FLT_ROUNDS != 0 &amp;&amp; FLT_ROUNDS != 1
    provided that an implementation extends FLT_ROUNDS to cover the rounding style used
    in all relevant LIA-1 operations, not just addition as in C.
<a name="H.2.4" href="#H.2.4"><b>    H.2.4 Type conversions</b></a>
1   The LIA-1 type conversions are the following type casts:
    cvtI' -&gt; I      (int)i, (long int)i, (long long int)i,
                   (unsigned int)i, (unsigned long int)i,
                   (unsigned long long int)i
    cvtF -&gt; I       (int)x, (long int)x, (long long int)x,
                   (unsigned int)x, (unsigned long int)x,
                   (unsigned long long int)x
    cvtI -&gt; F       (float)i, (double)i, (long double)i
    cvtF' -&gt; F      (float)x, (double)x, (long double)x
2   In the above conversions from floating to integer, the use of (cast)x can be replaced with
    (cast)round(x), (cast)rint(x), (cast)nearbyint(x), (cast)trunc(x),
    (cast)ceil(x), or (cast)floor(x). In addition, C's floating-point to integer
    conversion functions, lrint(), llrint(), lround(), and llround(), can be
    used. They all meet LIA-1's requirements on floating to integer rounding for in-range
    values. For out-of-range values, the conversions shall silently wrap for the modulo types.
3   The fmod() function is useful for doing silent wrapping to unsigned integer types, e.g.,
    fmod( fabs(rint(x)), 65536.0 ) or (0.0 &lt;= (y = fmod( rint(x),
    65536.0 )) ? y : 65536.0 + y) will compute an integer value in the range 0.0
    to 65535.0 which can then be cast to unsigned short int. But, the
    remainder() function is not useful for doing silent wrapping to signed integer types,
    e.g., remainder( rint(x), 65536.0 ) will compute an integer value in the
    range -32767.0 to +32768.0 which is not, in general, in the range of signed short
    int.
4   C's conversions (casts) from floating-point to floating-point can meet LIA-1
    requirements if an implementation uses round-to-nearest (IEC 60559 default).
5   C's conversions (casts) from integer to floating-point can meet LIA-1 requirements if an
    implementation uses round-to-nearest.

<a name="H.3" href="#H.3"><b>    H.3 Notification</b></a>
1   Notification is the process by which a user or program is informed that an exceptional
    arithmetic operation has occurred. C's operations are compatible with LIA-1 in that C
    allows an implementation to cause a notification to occur when any arithmetic operation
    returns an exceptional value as defined in LIA-1 clause 5.
<a name="H.3.1" href="#H.3.1"><b>    H.3.1 Notification alternatives</b></a>
1   LIA-1 requires at least the following two alternatives for handling of notifications:
    setting indicators or trap-and-terminate. LIA-1 allows a third alternative: trap-and-
    resume.
2   An implementation need only support a given notification alternative for the entire
    program. An implementation may support the ability to switch between notification
    alternatives during execution, but is not required to do so. An implementation can
    provide separate selection for each kind of notification, but this is not required.
3   C allows an implementation to provide notification. C's SIGFPE (for traps) and
    FE_INVALID, FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_UNDERFLOW (for indicators)
    can provide LIA-1 notification.
4   C's signal handlers are compatible with LIA-1. Default handling of SIGFPE can
    provide trap-and-terminate behavior, except for those LIA-1 operations implemented by
    math library function calls. User-provided signal handlers for SIGFPE allow for trap-
    and-resume behavior with the same constraint.
<a name="H.3.1.1" href="#H.3.1.1"><b>    H.3.1.1 Indicators</b></a>
1   C's <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> status flags are compatible with the LIA-1 indicators.
2   The following mapping is for floating-point types:
    undefined                FE_INVALID, FE_DIVBYZERO
    floating_overflow         FE_OVERFLOW
    underflow                FE_UNDERFLOW
3   The floating-point indicator interrogation and manipulation operations are:
    set_indicators          feraiseexcept(i)
    clear_indicators        feclearexcept(i)
    test_indicators         fetestexcept(i)
    current_indicators      fetestexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
    where i is an expression of type int representing a subset of the LIA-1 indicators.
4   C allows an implementation to provide the following LIA-1 required behavior: at
    program termination if any indicator is set the implementation shall send an unambiguous

[<a name="p485" href="#p485">page 485</a>] (<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>)

    and ''hard to ignore'' message (see LIA-1 subclause <a href="#6.1.2">6.1.2</a>)
5   LIA-1 does not make the distinction between floating-point and integer for ''undefined''.
    This documentation makes that distinction because <a href="#7.6">&lt;fenv.h&gt;</a> covers only the floating-
    point indicators.
<a name="H.3.1.2" href="#H.3.1.2"><b>    H.3.1.2 Traps</b></a>
1   C is compatible with LIA-1's trap requirements for arithmetic operations, but not for
    math library functions (which are not permitted to generate any externally visible
    exceptional conditions). An implementation can provide an alternative of notification
    through termination with a ''hard-to-ignore'' message (see LIA-1 subclause <a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>).
2   LIA-1 does not require that traps be precise.
3   C does require that SIGFPE be the signal corresponding to arithmetic exceptions, if there
    is any signal raised for them.
4   C supports signal handlers for SIGFPE and allows trapping of arithmetic exceptions.
    When arithmetic exceptions do trap, C's signal-handler mechanism allows trap-and-
    terminate (either default implementation behavior or user replacement for it) or trap-and-
    resume, at the programmer's option.

<a name="J.5" href="#J.5"><b>    J.5 Common extensions</b></a>
1   The following extensions are widely used in many systems, but are not portable to all
    implementations. The inclusion of any extension that may cause a strictly conforming
    program to become invalid renders an implementation nonconforming. Examples of such
    extensions are new keywords, extra library functions declared in standard headers, or
    predefined macros with names that do not begin with an underscore.
<a name="J.5.1" href="#J.5.1"><b>    J.5.1 Environment arguments</b></a>
1   In a hosted environment, the main function receives a third argument, char *envp[],
    that points to a null-terminated array of pointers to char, each of which points to a string
    that provides information about the environment for this execution of the program
    (<a href="#5.1.2.2.1">5.1.2.2.1</a>).
<a name="J.5.2" href="#J.5.2"><b>    J.5.2 Specialized identifiers</b></a>
1   Characters other than the underscore _, letters, and digits, that are not part of the basic
    source character set (such as the dollar sign $, or characters in national character sets)
    may appear in an identifier (<a href="#6.4.2">6.4.2</a>).
<a name="J.5.3" href="#J.5.3"><b>    J.5.3 Lengths and cases of identifiers</b></a>

<a name="J.5.4" href="#J.5.4"><b>    J.5.4 Scopes of identifiers</b></a>
1   A function identifier, or the identifier of an object the declaration of which contains the

<a name="J.5.5" href="#J.5.5"><b>    J.5.5 Writable string literals</b></a>

    appropriate conversions are defined (<a href="#6.2.5">6.2.5</a>, <a href="#6.3.1">6.3.1</a>). Additional floating types may have
    more range or precision than long double, may be used for evaluating expressions of

    be invoked as a function (<a href="#6.5.4">6.5.4</a>).
2   A pointer to a function may be cast to a pointer to an object or to void, allowing a
    function to be inspected or modified (for example, by a debugger) (<a href="#6.5.4">6.5.4</a>).
<a name="J.5.8" href="#J.5.8"><b>    J.5.8 Extended bit-field types</b></a>

<a name="J.5.9" href="#J.5.9"><b>    J.5.9 The fortran keyword</b></a>
1   The fortran function specifier may be used in a function declaration to indicate that
    calls suitable for FORTRAN should be generated, or that a different representation for the

<a name="J.5.10" href="#J.5.10"><b>    J.5.10 The asm keyword</b></a>
1   The asm keyword may be used to insert assembly language directly into the translator
    output (<a href="#6.8">6.8</a>). The most common implementation is via a statement of the form:
           asm ( character-string-literal );
<a name="J.5.11" href="#J.5.11"><b>    J.5.11 Multiple external definitions</b></a>
1   There may be more than one external definition for the identifier of an object, with or
    without the explicit use of the keyword extern; if the definitions disagree, or more than

<a name="J.5.13" href="#J.5.13"><b>    J.5.13 Floating-point status flags</b></a>
1   If any floating-point status flags are set on normal termination after all calls to functions
