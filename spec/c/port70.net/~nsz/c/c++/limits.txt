Implementation quantities

Because computers are finite, C++ implementations are inevitably limited in the
size of the programs they can successfully process. Every implementation shall
document those limitations where known. This documentation may cite fixed limits
where they exist, say how to compute variable limits as a function of available
resources, or say that fixed limits do not exist or are unknown. The limits may
constrain quantities that include those described below or others. The bracketed
number following each quantity is recommended as the minimum for that quantity.
However, these quantities are only guidelines and do not determine compliance.
